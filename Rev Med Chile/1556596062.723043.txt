Hepatitis aguda por mononucleosis infecciosa en un varón de 21 años

Un paciente           varón de 21 años, fue hospitalizado por fiebre, astenia,           cefalea, faringitis, dolor abdominal, pérdida del apetito,           vómitos y orina oscura desde tres días antes. El paciente negó           uso reciente de medicamentos y cualquier otra droga. Su examen           físico reveló ictericia, hepato-esplenomegalia, amigdalitis,           adenopatías cervicales anteriores y posteriores, asociadas con           edema facial y cervical. Los exámenes de laboratorio mostraron           elevación sérica de bilirrubina y enzimas hepáticas           (bilirrubina total: 14,5 mg/dl, bilirrubina directa: 12,9           mg/dl, AST: 697 U/l, ALT: 619 U/l, fosfatasas alcalinas: 260           U/l, y gama-GT: 413 U/l). Los tests serológicos resultaron           negativos para hepatitis viral A, B o C, citomegalovirus,           VIH-1 y VIH-2, y toxoplasmosis; pero la serología de infección           reciente por VEB fue positiva (IgM: 70 y 29 U/ml; IgG: 25 y           156 U/ml). Aunque raramente, las infecciones por VEB pueden           causar una hepatitis aguda con acentuada ictericia colestásica           (5% de los casos), que suele constituir un desafío diagnóstico           adicional para los médicos en atención primaria. El paciente           mejoró durante un tratamiento de apoyo y recibió alta           hospitalaria después de 12 días. Este caso estimula a aumentar     el índice de sospecha de hepatitis aguda relacionada con VEB.

 

Epstein-Barr virus         (EBV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family and the         causal agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM)1, which         is also called Pfeiffer's disease, kissing disease, glandular         fever, and monocytic angina. In Brazil as well as in Chile, IM         more often occurs among children, adolescents, and young adults2,         with high seroprevalence of EBV in adults3. The acute         manifestations of primary IM are usually benign, but its         severity and the duration of the disease are variable. Chronic         active infection and diverse malignancies have been associated         with EBV, including gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinomas,         Burkitt's and Hodgkin's lymphomas, and leukemia1,4,5.         Classical features of IM are fever, pharingo-tonsilitis, lymph         node enlargement, hepato-splenomegaly, and lymphocytosis with         large number of atypical lymphocytes6-9. The wide         spectrum of signs and symptoms of IM may pose diagnostic         challenges, with under recognition or misdiagnosis. Severe or         fatal IM is very rare, but is growing in number, and may involve         hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and fulminant hepatitis4,5.         The management of IM is based on supportive care, including         adequate rest and well controlled hydration and nutrition, with         the exception of some severe complications8,10. IM         can cause mild to moderate elevations of direct-reacting         bilirubin and aminotransferases, and deep jaundice due to         direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia is an uncommon finding in the         course of primary EBV infections in immunocompetent young adults1,7-10.

Case report

A 21-year-old male         was admitted because of fever, fatigue, headache, pharyngitis,         abdominal pain, loss of appetite, vomiting and dark urine for         three days. He did not take any medicine previously to         admission, and denied use of illicit drugs, alcohol abuse or         tobacco smoking. A vaccinated cat is his pet, and his girl-friend         had a recent "flu-like" condition. His physical examination         disclosed hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, enlarged tonsils with         white exudates and injection, intense jaundice in the skin and         in conjunctival mucosa, and bilateral enlargement of         supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes with conspicuous facial         and cervical edema resembling a "proconsular" or "bull" neck (Figure 1). The painless lymph nodes had a         fibroelastic consisteney, with major diameters ranging from 0.5         to 2.0 cm, and were also palpated with similar features on both         axillary regions. Abdominal ultrasound images confirmed the moderate         hepatic and spleen enlargements. Laboratory findings are showed         in Table 1, characterizing an acute hepatitis         associated with a recent infection by EBV. Worth of note was         leukocytosis and lymphocytosis with a high rate (24%) of         atypical cells; the initial low platelet count, the elevated         serum levels of aminotransferases as well as of the canalicular         hepatic enzymes, and the very high (near 13 mg/dl)         direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. The diagnosis was acute         hepatitis associated with infectious mononucleosis due to EBV.         He was successfully managed with clinical and nutritional         support, and symptomatic medicines. After clinical improvement,         and tendency to normalization of laboratory data, the patient         was discharged home on Day 15, and was further referred to         specialized outpatient surveillance. On Day 34, his physical         examination was unremarkable, with absence of jaundice and lymph         node enlargement (Figura 2)         or visceromegaly. On the same occasion, almost all control         laboratory tests were within the normal ranges, except for low         indices of red cells and elevated GGT. The serology tests showed         an increased level of EBV IgG, while the IgM level had lowered.         Actually, the patient is asymptomatic, performing his normal         daily activities.

 



 



 



Discussion

Adolescents and         adults usually develop the classical features of IM, with an         incubation period from 30 to 50 days10, followed by a         symptomatic phase of variable duration. Fever, asthenia,         headache, myalgias, pharyngitis and lymph node enlargement are         the most common signs and symptoms10, and our patient         presented most of them.         There was an absolute lymphocytosis, as observed in 70% of cases         with a peak between the second and third weeks. He had a large         number (11 to 24%) of atypical lymphocytes, which constitutes a         major characteristic of IM, although it is not pathognomonic.         His serum levels of ALT and AST were moderately elevated, as         described in 80 to 90% of acute infections10; and         alkaline phosphatases were also elevated, as found in 60% of the         patients with IM4. Discrete elevations of bilirubin         occur in about 45% of patients4, but clinical         jaundice is observed in only 5% of cases10, in         contrast with the very high level of direct-reacting bilirubin         observed in the case here reported. Notably, intense cholestasis         may affect elderly patients, and can mimic biliary obstruction4.         Differential diagnoses of IM include other infections (e.g.         cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, rubella, viral hepatitis,         leptospirosis, and scratch-cat disease), lymphoma, and leukemia.         Interestingly, household contact with cat might raise the         hypotheses of toxoplasmosis and scratch-cat disease. However,         diagnosis of IM in the patient described herein was based on         typical clinical and hematological data, and was confirmed by         significant EBV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies10.         Although acyclovir can inhibit the EBV replication and may         reduce viral excretion, it has no significant effects on the         clinical manifestations4. Uncomplicated cases of IM         are usually managed by symptomatic and nutritional support10.         Mechanisms of liver injuries related to EBV infections are not         entirely clear, and include: products of immune responses to         viral antigens (interferon γ, TNFα, Fas ligand), infected CD8+ T         cells, and infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes10, in         addition to immunodeficiency syndromes, complement deficiency,         X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, or treatment8.         Because the prevalence of IM is very high worldwide7,8,10,         there is a concern about possible under diagnosis, misdiagnosis,         or underreporting of EBV-induced liver changes8.         Although EBV-related acute hepatitis with jaundice has been         scarcely reported, this condition may be under diagnosed in         young patients9, because clinical and laboratory         features (except for serology data) may be identical to that         associated with the classic hepatotropic virases4.         Kang et al described two cases of acute hepatitis by EBV in         Korean adults (aged 20 and 24 years) and, worth of note, one of         them presented concomitant infection by hepatitis A virus10.         Clinical findings and laboratory data were similar in both cases; however, the patient         with hepatitis A virus coinfection showed two times higher         levels of total (4.0 versus 2.1 mg/dl) and of direct-reacting         (2.4 versus 1.2 mg/dl) bilirubin, and lower levels of GGT (69         versus 235 U/I). Interestingly, both patients improved with         clinical management in a period of two weeks10.         Cybulska et al reviewed three cases of EBV-related acute         hepatitis in Canadian pediatric patients aged from 5 to 14.4         years. Their clinical course was benign, with abdominal pain,         jaundice and ALT levels ranging between 126 and 196 U/ml, which         normalized with time11. Other authors have emphasized         that many discharge diagnosis of viral hepatitis in children         have no confirmed etiology, contributing to under detection of         other hepatotropic viruses like EBV11. Kofteridis et         al reviewed 41 cases of acute hepatitis by EBV in Greek adults         with a median age of 18.5 (15-51) years, and described a         self-limiting condition, mainly cholestatic12.         Similar to the laboratory findings in our patient, the levels of         AST and ALT started to rise early in the onset of IM, and         normalized in about three weeks, as well as the bilirubin and         alkaline phosphatases, while the levels of GGT normalized later         (after a period of 30 days)12. Vine et al reviewed 17         patients with diagnosis of acute hepatitis by EBV in the UK and         found an age range of 18-68 years (median of 40 years). Seven         patients (41%) were aged ≤ 30 years, similar to the present         report. Brief hospitalization was necessary for three of the 17         patients, and the course of acute hepatitis was anicteric in two         cases. They concluded that EBV hepatitis is an uncommon         self-limiting entity, mainly detected among people aged ≥ 60         years9. The purpose of this case study is to         highlight the intense jaundice (bilirubin > 14 mg/dl) due to         an acute hepatitis caused by EBV, which occurred in a young         adult with classical IM. We also emphasize that EBV infections         can origin acute hepatitis with cholestasis, and can contribute         to diagnosis pitfalls in primary care settings. Case studies may         enhance the suspicion index about acute hepatitis by EBV,         possibly under recognized in young patients.
