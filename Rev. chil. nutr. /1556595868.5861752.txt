ABSTRACT

Although          many studies point to alterations in the organic concentrations of zinc          in elderly patients, the mechanisms by which aging might cause changes          in the metabolism of this nutrient remain unclear. Thus, we assessed the          changes in plasma zinc, zinc binding capacity to plasma protein (ZnBCPP)          and saturation índex (SI), comparing elderly individuáis and young adults.          The zinc analyses were performed by atonde absorption spectrophotometry.          A statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) wasfound between          the two groups in relation to plasma zinc and SI, but the ZnBCPP did not          differ between the younger and older subjects. In agreement with this          result, it was shown in the young group that 76% (R2 = 0.760)          of the ZnBCPP variations are explained by the variations in plasma zinc          and SI. In the elderly group this measure decreased to 30.5% (R2          = 0.305). We conclude, therefore, that aging may be a factor associated          to changes in control mechanisms and in zinc homeostasis, and could even          alter ZnBCPP response patterns and other zinc-related indicators of nutritional          status.

RESUMEN

A pesar que          muchos estudios indicarían que existen alteraciones en las concentraciones          orgánicas del zinc en pacientes mayores, los mecanismos por los cuales          el envejecimiento podría implicar cambios en el metabolismo de esta nutriente,          aún permanecen pocos claros. Buscamos evaluar los cambios relativos al          zinc plasmático, a la Capacidad de Ligación del Zinc a la Proteína Plasmática          (ZnBCPP) y en el índice de Saturación (SI). Los análisis de zinc fueron          realizados por espectrofotometría de absorción atómica, comparando personas          mayores y adultos jóvenes. Una diferencia significativa fue encontrada          (p< 0,001), entre los dos grupos, en relación al zinc plasmático e          SI, siendo que la ZnBCPP no cambió entre los jóvenes y adultos mayores.          Constatando este resultado, se demostró que en el grupo de jóvenes las          variaciones en la ZnBCPP son explicadas en 76% (R2= 0,760)          por las variaciones en el zinc plasmático en el SI. En el grupo de los          mayores esta medida disminuye a 30,5% (R2= 0,305). Concluimos          que el envejecimiento puede ser un factor asociado a los cambios en los          mecanismos de control y homeostasis del zinc, alternando los patrones          de respuesta relativos a ZnBCPP y algunos otros indicadores del estado          nutricional relativo al zinc.

INTRODUCTION

Zinc is indispensable          to the organism, due to the various biological functions it exercises          in its role as a biochemical, regulating and structural agent. Even when          there is a slight zinc deficieney, it is possible to detect consequences          such as greater susceptibility to infection and cicatrization problems          (1).

The elderly          are at risk of zinc deficieney, due to their low dietary ingestión, lack          of appetite, and interactions with medications. Moreover, there are indications          that, although the zinc requirements of the elderly are similar to those          of adulthood, the capacity to regúlate the body pool is diminished (2).

Although          there is much evidence that zinc deficiency, even a slight degree, is          prevalent worldwide, particularly in specific population groups, such          as the elderly, a totally reliable method to assess it has yet to be established          (3).

Most studies,          especially epidemiological, use plasma zinc as the measuring parameter.          However, despite its convenience, this indicator is not considered to          be sensitive enough to diagnose zinc status in the organism, since it          is subject to circadian variations (4).

Therefore,          more than one parameter mustbe used to perform this diagnosis. One of          these parameters is Zinc Binding Capacity to Plasma Protein In humans,          serum zinc is nearly totally protein-bound, primarily to albumin and a¿-macroglobulin;          and to a lesser extent to amino acids and transferrin. In healthy individuáis          it has been observed that the greater part of total serum zinc is bound          to albumin and that only a small amount is bound to a2- macroglobulin.          This means that the measure of serum albumin and of total serum zinc can          be used to estímate a physiologically important fraction of serum zinc          in healthy patients (5).

In some situations,          zinc binding to proteins is a result of the plasma zinc transfer to intracellular          sites, which normally occurs after surgery or similar stressful events.          Under more stable clinical conditions, nearly all the plasma zinc is bound          to proteins, and changes in it concentration occur in response to factors          unrelated to the availability of this metal (6).

The method          that determines zinc-binding capacity in serum or plasma s based that          a known amount of zinc ions satúrate the protein carriers of this metal.          Non-residual zinc or free zinc (not protein-bound) is determined by a          reaction with magnesium hydroxicarbonate, which has a relatively high          solubility. However, the product of this reaction, zinc hydroxide, has          low solubility, precipitates immediately and, even if the reaction is          displaced in the inverse direction, this compound continúes to precipítate.          This method ensures, however, that all the non protein-bound zinc is eliminated          (or quelated) when there is excessive basic magnesium carbonate (7).

Some authors          have reported that the Zinc Binding Capacity to Plasma Protein the only          technique using serum is useful in determining modérate states of zinc          deficiency and is more reliable that the simple measuring of zinc in these          compartments (8- 10).

Thus, the          aim of this study was to assess plasma zinc and ZnBCPP in adults and elderly          individuáis, to determine zinc-related changes in nutritional status caused          by the aging process.

SUBJETCS          AND METHOD

A cross-sectional          study was conducted in a group of elderly subjects older than 60 years          of age, of both sexes (n = 14); and the other group was composed of university          undergraduates (n = 57) from the city of Natal, Brazil. The subjects were          chosen randomly firom those who declared themselves healthy and who had          no history of chronic diseases and/or health problems in the previous          year. The elderly underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination. The following          exclusión criteria were established: the presence of gastrointestinal          disorders, obesity or current malnutrition, chronic and/or acute diseases          and the use of vitamin-mineral supplementation or other medication that          might interfere in normal zinc metabolism. The study was approved by the          Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte          (UFRN).

The zinc          plasma dosage was calculated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry according          to the method proposed by Rodríguez et al. (11), and the Zinc Binding          Capacity to Plasma Protein (ZnBCPP) was determined using methodology standardized          by Argemi et al. (10) and Cunningham et al. (8), modified by Pedrosa et          al. (12).

Two 0.5 mL          aliquots of plasma were removed and mixed in equal volume of a standard          zinc solution of 10 mcg Zn/mL. The addition, in serum or in plasma, of          a known amount of zinc ions, aimed at saturating the carrier proteins          of this metal. The plasma proteins were then precipitated, with the addition          of 85 mg of magnesium hydroxicarbonate and 4 mL of ultrapure water (MLLLI-Q),          which enabled the quantification of the free zinc (non protein-bound).          After centrifugation, the amount of zinc in the supernatant was analyzed          by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (SPECTRA VARÍAN AA-200). The results          were expressed in ugzn/g of plasma protein.

The saturation          index was calculated according to Arcasoy et al. (13), using the %SI formula          (plasma Zn/ZnBCPP x 100).

The plasma          proteins were measured colorimetrically with the BioSystems total protein          kit.

To calcúlate          Body Mass índex (BMI) we measured weight on a digital scale and height          with a non-extendable tape measure.

Dietary zinc          was assessed in the older group by a 3-day food record and in the younger          group by a 24-hour record, and all data were subsequently analyzed with          the Virtual Nutrí program, versión 1.0.

Student's          ttest was used to analyze the independent samples and Pearson's correlation          coefficient between the dependent variables was calculated considering          a confidence interval of 95%. The linear regression model comprised backward          selection between the plasma zinc variables, zinc binding capacity to          plasma protein and saturation index, using SPSS software.

RESULTS          AND DISCUSSION

Table          1 shows that the assessed groups had normal BMI and total protein          valúes. The volunteers of this study, in general, had a good socioeconomic          level, that is, they had access to health services and nutritional food.          This situation is reflected in the concentration of plasma proteins, in          which no statistical difference was found between the younger and older          groups.     

Plasma protein          concentration is one of the parameters used to obtain ZnBCPP, whose alterations          may influence this concentration. Since both groups had normal concentrations          valúes with no significant difference between them, this result suggests          that this variable had a low impact on the other results of the study. To assess          the zinc x plasma protein relation, we performed a study that evaluated          zinc distribution after acute myocardial infarction. An excellent correlation          was observed between total zinc and protein-bound zinc, but practically          no relation was found between zinc and its plasma carriers (albumin and          a-2-macroglobulin) (14). The author suggests that the relation between          zinc and plasma proteins is established by some additional factor and          not only as a function of the amount of mineral in the organism and the          presence of firee carriers. We suggest,          therefore, that the aging process is one of the passive factors influencing          this relation and the metabolic regulation of zinc. Jong et al.          (15) assessed a cohort of New Zealand women, whose plasma protein levéis          were normal, and found low plasma zinc valúes among the elderly and no          association between this zinc parameter and the ingestión of the mineral.          A similar situation was found by PEPERSACK et al (16), who evaluated elderly          hospitalized patients, and also found no relation between low plasma zinc          levéis and the amount of plasma proteins. These results reinforce the          need for other markers to better interpret and/or assess the zinc x plasma          protein relation. Table          2 shows the group differences in zinc concentration and in the saturation          of its carriers, which seems to indicate changes in the metabolism of          this mineral, possible related to age.     

Although          the plasma zinc valúes of the two groups were in the normal range, which          is from 70 to 120 ug Zn/dL (17), there was a statistical difference between          the older and younger subjects, finding also observed in plasma protein          saturation, which was lower in the elderly. That is, there was less zinc          bound to this group and therefore more free carriers, theoretically passive          of being occupied by a larger amount of the mineral. There was          no statistical difference between the groups in relation to ZnBCPP, although          it was higher in the elderly group. However, in the context formed by          the other indicators, with plasma zinc and the saturation index differing          statistically between the groups, a larger ZnBCPP valué was expected than          that found in the elderly subjects. This being          so, no proportional increase in ZnBCPP was found as a response to plasma          zinc and the saturation index. The dietary          ingestión of zinc/day was 9.73 ± 0.91 mg in the younger group and          9.41 ± 1.0 in the older group, without statistically significant          differences between them ( p = 0.8642). Thus, we can deduce that the amount          of dietary zinc has no effect on the differences found between the groups,          in terms of plasma zinc and saturation index. We can infer,          therefore, that the older group had less "desire" and/or "competence"          in binding zinc to the plasma protein pool, suggesting changes in zinc          homeostasis. This could represent a greater difficulty in organic supply          owing to a shortage and/or need to increase the continuous offer of zinc          to reestablish this equilibrium. The apparent          change in the strength of this relation, where we can apparently relate          aging with a smaller association between plasma protein saturation, plasma          zinc and ZnBCPP, leads us to speculate about the differences between young          adults and the elderly in dealing with high zinc doses, administered via          supplements and/or their dietary effectiveness. Grosshauer          et al. (18) assessed ZnBCPP in athletes, before and after a zinc supplementation          program. One of the groups evaluated showed significant differences in          plasma zinc and ZnBCPP valúes, before and after supplementation; that          is, as the amount of zinc increased, there was an increase in zinc plasma          and an inversely proportional concomitant decrease in protein-binding          capacity, related to the organic status of the mineral. A study by          Faure et al (19) analyzed zinc metabolism using stable isotopes, comparing          a group of young women (mean age of 36 years) and a group of institutionalized          (mean age of 73 years) and non-institutionalized (mean age of 72 years)          elderly patients. Although zinc ingestión was similar in all the groups,          differences were found in the metabolism of the mineral, in relation to          the duration of the zinc in the plasma. The authors suggest that this          may be related, among other factors, to the aging process and to some          alteration in plasma protein-bound zinc. Linear regression          analysis showed that, in the younger group, the variations in ZnBCPP are          explained in 76% (R2 = 0.760) of the cases by plasma zinc variations          and the saturation index. In the older group this response decreased to          30.5% (R2 = 0.305). That is, there is a clear indication of          changes in the mechanisms of zinc homeostasis related to aging, which          involve alterations in the response patterns of ZnBCPP to the organic          concentrations of zinc and their relation with the other zinc parameters          in the organism. Briefly,          we observed this change in response pattern of the indicators, when we          compared the older and younger groups, since, although the elderly apparently          have more "space" to bind the zinc. This is reflected by a lower          saturation index and lower amount of plasma zinc. This was also shown          in the ZnBCPP, that is, although there is more space, the plasma proteins          have seemingly less desire or ability to bind/capture zinc. Mocchegiani          et al (20) suggested that these changes in the binding of zinc to carrier          proteins observed in aging may be considered potential markers to assess          organism aging and a factor to be considered when defining proper diet          for this stage of life. Furthermore,          Ravaglia et al. (21) and Savarino et al. (22) assessed groups at different          life stages and found that, even among the elderly, there are differences          between plasma zinc patterns, which seems to decline proportionally to          age, being lower, for example, in 90 year-old individuáis than in 70 year-old. Mocchegiani          et al. (23) offer evidence for understanding these mechanisms. According          to these authors, over the course of the aging process there is an overexpression          of some zinc-binding proteins such as metalloproteins and a-2-macroglobulin,          which decreases zinc bioavailability in the organism. It is even speculated          that this is one of the causes of immune function deficiency in the elderly. We conclude          therefore, that aging may be a factor associated to changes in control          mechanisms and zinc homeostasis. It may even alter the response patterns          of ZnBCPP and the other indicators of zinc-related nutritional status. We suggest          new studies, focused on the plasma protein profile, ZnBCPP and the response          to different zinc supplementation regimens in the elderly, to help in          the implementation of differential clinical practices for this vulnerable          group.

Plasma protein          concentration is one of the parameters used to obtain ZnBCPP, whose alterations          may influence this concentration. Since both groups had normal concentrations          valúes with no significant difference between them, this result suggests          that this variable had a low impact on the other results of the study.

To assess          the zinc x plasma protein relation, we performed a study that evaluated          zinc distribution after acute myocardial infarction. An excellent correlation          was observed between total zinc and protein-bound zinc, but practically          no relation was found between zinc and its plasma carriers (albumin and          a-2-macroglobulin) (14). The author suggests that the relation between          zinc and plasma proteins is established by some additional factor and          not only as a function of the amount of mineral in the organism and the          presence of firee carriers.

We suggest,          therefore, that the aging process is one of the passive factors influencing          this relation and the metabolic regulation of zinc.

Jong et al.          (15) assessed a cohort of New Zealand women, whose plasma protein levéis          were normal, and found low plasma zinc valúes among the elderly and no          association between this zinc parameter and the ingestión of the mineral.          A similar situation was found by PEPERSACK et al (16), who evaluated elderly          hospitalized patients, and also found no relation between low plasma zinc          levéis and the amount of plasma proteins. These results reinforce the          need for other markers to better interpret and/or assess the zinc x plasma          protein relation.

Table          2 shows the group differences in zinc concentration and in the saturation          of its carriers, which seems to indicate changes in the metabolism of          this mineral, possible related to age.     

Although          the plasma zinc valúes of the two groups were in the normal range, which          is from 70 to 120 ug Zn/dL (17), there was a statistical difference between          the older and younger subjects, finding also observed in plasma protein          saturation, which was lower in the elderly. That is, there was less zinc          bound to this group and therefore more free carriers, theoretically passive          of being occupied by a larger amount of the mineral. There was          no statistical difference between the groups in relation to ZnBCPP, although          it was higher in the elderly group. However, in the context formed by          the other indicators, with plasma zinc and the saturation index differing          statistically between the groups, a larger ZnBCPP valué was expected than          that found in the elderly subjects. This being          so, no proportional increase in ZnBCPP was found as a response to plasma          zinc and the saturation index. The dietary          ingestión of zinc/day was 9.73 ± 0.91 mg in the younger group and          9.41 ± 1.0 in the older group, without statistically significant          differences between them ( p = 0.8642). Thus, we can deduce that the amount          of dietary zinc has no effect on the differences found between the groups,          in terms of plasma zinc and saturation index. We can infer,          therefore, that the older group had less "desire" and/or "competence"          in binding zinc to the plasma protein pool, suggesting changes in zinc          homeostasis. This could represent a greater difficulty in organic supply          owing to a shortage and/or need to increase the continuous offer of zinc          to reestablish this equilibrium. The apparent          change in the strength of this relation, where we can apparently relate          aging with a smaller association between plasma protein saturation, plasma          zinc and ZnBCPP, leads us to speculate about the differences between young          adults and the elderly in dealing with high zinc doses, administered via          supplements and/or their dietary effectiveness. Grosshauer          et al. (18) assessed ZnBCPP in athletes, before and after a zinc supplementation          program. One of the groups evaluated showed significant differences in          plasma zinc and ZnBCPP valúes, before and after supplementation; that          is, as the amount of zinc increased, there was an increase in zinc plasma          and an inversely proportional concomitant decrease in protein-binding          capacity, related to the organic status of the mineral. A study by          Faure et al (19) analyzed zinc metabolism using stable isotopes, comparing          a group of young women (mean age of 36 years) and a group of institutionalized          (mean age of 73 years) and non-institutionalized (mean age of 72 years)          elderly patients. Although zinc ingestión was similar in all the groups,          differences were found in the metabolism of the mineral, in relation to          the duration of the zinc in the plasma. The authors suggest that this          may be related, among other factors, to the aging process and to some          alteration in plasma protein-bound zinc. Linear regression          analysis showed that, in the younger group, the variations in ZnBCPP are          explained in 76% (R2 = 0.760) of the cases by plasma zinc variations          and the saturation index. In the older group this response decreased to          30.5% (R2 = 0.305). That is, there is a clear indication of          changes in the mechanisms of zinc homeostasis related to aging, which          involve alterations in the response patterns of ZnBCPP to the organic          concentrations of zinc and their relation with the other zinc parameters          in the organism. Briefly,          we observed this change in response pattern of the indicators, when we          compared the older and younger groups, since, although the elderly apparently          have more "space" to bind the zinc. This is reflected by a lower          saturation index and lower amount of plasma zinc. This was also shown          in the ZnBCPP, that is, although there is more space, the plasma proteins          have seemingly less desire or ability to bind/capture zinc. Mocchegiani          et al (20) suggested that these changes in the binding of zinc to carrier          proteins observed in aging may be considered potential markers to assess          organism aging and a factor to be considered when defining proper diet          for this stage of life. Furthermore,          Ravaglia et al. (21) and Savarino et al. (22) assessed groups at different          life stages and found that, even among the elderly, there are differences          between plasma zinc patterns, which seems to decline proportionally to          age, being lower, for example, in 90 year-old individuáis than in 70 year-old. Mocchegiani          et al. (23) offer evidence for understanding these mechanisms. According          to these authors, over the course of the aging process there is an overexpression          of some zinc-binding proteins such as metalloproteins and a-2-macroglobulin,          which decreases zinc bioavailability in the organism. It is even speculated          that this is one of the causes of immune function deficiency in the elderly. We conclude          therefore, that aging may be a factor associated to changes in control          mechanisms and zinc homeostasis. It may even alter the response patterns          of ZnBCPP and the other indicators of zinc-related nutritional status. We suggest          new studies, focused on the plasma protein profile, ZnBCPP and the response          to different zinc supplementation regimens in the elderly, to help in          the implementation of differential clinical practices for this vulnerable          group.

Although          the plasma zinc valúes of the two groups were in the normal range, which          is from 70 to 120 ug Zn/dL (17), there was a statistical difference between          the older and younger subjects, finding also observed in plasma protein          saturation, which was lower in the elderly. That is, there was less zinc          bound to this group and therefore more free carriers, theoretically passive          of being occupied by a larger amount of the mineral.

There was          no statistical difference between the groups in relation to ZnBCPP, although          it was higher in the elderly group.
