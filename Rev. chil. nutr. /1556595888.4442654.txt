El hambre oculta y la fibromialgia: Una revisión sistemática

Eligibility Criteria

The following exclusion criteria were used: 1) non-clinical studies; 2) studies on nutritional supplementation and drug therapy; and 3) studies whose participants have FM associated with comorbidities (psychiatric and somatic) and musculoskeletal pain or fatigue.

All participants were adults (male and female aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with FM according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria3, with no clinical signs of micronutrient deficiency. All studies included in this review were observational studies (case-control, cross-sectional and cohort study).

Study Selection Process

The identification and selection of articles were based on title and reading through the abstracts. All duplicate studies in different databases were counted only once. From the selected articles, a reverse citation search to find other relevant studies was done. The full texts of all relevant articles were read.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

All eligible reports were independently reviewed by two authors. For the characterization of the articles, the following information was extracted using an excel datasheet: lead author, year of publication and country where the study was conducted; study design; participants, criteria for diagnosing FM syndrome, characteristics and size of sample; indicator and cut-off point, limitations and main results.

The methodological quality of each article was evaluated according to the Downs & Black checklist14 for measuring quality. This checklist contains 27 questions divided into four groups: presentation (evaluates items such as clarity in the description of objectives, existence of confounding variables, probability values); external validity (related to the extrapolation of data from the planned sample to a population); internal validity (bias analysis, reliability of measurements of exposure and outcome); and statistical power of the study.

In this study, items 4, 8, 12, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24 and 27 were excluded because they refer to clinical trials. Thus, only 19 items were evaluated, with a maximum score of 20 points. The scale questions allow for objective evaluation of an article under analysis regarding whether or not it answers the questions posed. For each item, the zero score (0) is assigned if the article does not conform to what is being evaluated. On the contrary, score one (1) is assigned when the article provides an answer. Only item 5 assigns a score of 2, if the question is answered by the article.

RESULTS

Characteristics of Included Studies

During the initial database search, we pre-selected 94 studies with 17 repeated in the searched databases. After reviewing the titles/abstracts and reading the articles, only 14 articles12,13,15–26 met the eligibility criteria adopted and correlated micronutrient deficiency to the presence of FM (Figure 1).



The parameters evaluated in each study and the characteristics of the participants are presented in tables 1 and 2.

Observational studies such as cross-sectional (n= 13) and cohort (n= 1), conducted in South America (n= 1), Europe (n= 3) and Asia (n= 10) were selected. The 14 studies included comprised of 713 FM patients with ages between 20 and 75 years, and 722 control participants with ages between 22 and 71 years. Most studies enrolled people with no pain symptoms as controls; only one study recruited patients with lower back pain and/or tendinitis15. Twelve studies focused on women and two included both sex22,25. The threshold defined for vitamin D deficiency varied among citations; with 20 ng/mL being the most utilized.

The indicators and cutoff points for mineral deficiency varied among the studies and only one study defined a cutoff point for Fe deficiency23.

Eight studies linked vitamin D deficiency to the presence of FM15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. However, only two papers found a positive correlation between low serum levels of vitamin D and FM. A case-control study conducted in Egypt18 observed that vitamin D deficiency (using a cutoff of < 20 ng/mL for levels of 25-OHD) is common in premenopausal women with FM (age: 32.3 ± 9.4) and occurs more frequently in patients with anxiety and depression. A cohort study in Northern Ireland22 found an association between pain levels and vitamin D deficiency in patients with FM, based on the investigation of 75 patients (70 women and 5 men aged 21-75 years). Two other studies found an association between pain and vitamin D levels in patients with FM15,17.

Six studies related mineral deficiency to FM12,13,23,24,25,26. Two studies identified an association between mineral deficiency and FM. Sendur et al.24 observed lower levels of Zn and Mg in the blood of Turkish women with FM (age: 42.9 ± 7.7 years). Low Zn levels were associated with the number of tender points and fatigue was associated with low Mg levels. A study conducted in South Korea13 found positive associations between FM and low levels of Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe measured in the hair of patients aged 42.5 ± 6.9 years (Table 2).

Quality of selected studies

The scores of the studies according to the Downs & Black checklist14 varied from 14 to 18 points (average: 16 points). Regarding presentation, all studies scored positively in the description of objectives, methods of measurement and presentation of main results. Only eight studies scored points for external validity and the vast majority had low scores for internal validity.

DISCUSSION

I. Vitamin deficiency in Fibromyalgia

Vitamin deficiency has been directly linked to the pathophysiology of several chronic non-communicable musculoskeletal diseases, including osteoporosis, myofascial pain syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, myositis, and FM10,27,28,29,30.

Patients with myofascial pain syndrome exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin inadequacy or deficiency27. Folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency reduces red blood cell production, leading to reduced oxygen transport. The consequent dysfunctions in muscle energy metabolism at the motor end plates results in painful muscular regions known as trigger points27.

In this review, two studies identified a positive correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the presence of FM18,22 and two others identified an association between pain levels and vitamin D levels in FM15,17.

Recent studies have indicated vitamin D deficiency as the main trigger factor for diseases related to chronic diffused pain, myofascial pain, joint pain, muscle weakness and fatigue10,11,30,31. According to Schinchuk and Holick28, vitamin D deficiency causes osteopenia, and it precipitates and exacerbates osteoporosis, leading to osteomalacia, a painful bone disease. In addition, vitamin D deficiency reduces the strength of proximal muscles and postural balance, and should therefore be considered in the diagnosis of FM.

Vitamin D from the skin and diet is metabolized in the liver to 25-OHD, which is used for determining vitamin D status in the blood32. 25-OHD is then metabolized in the kidneys by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D- 1alpha-hidroxylase (CYP27B1) in its active form, 1.25 (OH)2D. Renal 1.25(OH)2D is regulated by the plasma levels of parathyroid hormone and the serum levels of Ca and phosphorus. In this sense, Lewis et al.33 believed that FM could be the result of a physiological blockade within the parathyroid axis due to suppressed parathyroid hormone secretion and/or renal excretion of phosphorus with subsequent interruption of the final steps in vitamin D activation and systemic action.

The biological actions of vitamin D in the nervous system include the biosynthesis of neurotrophic factors and synthesis of neurotransmitters, in addition to playing a role in brain detoxification (e.g.: inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis)34.

Studies have related FM to neuroendocrine abnormalities involving the HPA axis and deficit in the endogenous pain modulation systems4,5. The main aspect related to the symptoms of FM is the presence of chronic widespread pain. Chronic pain has been associated with changes in brain anatomy, particularly related to the reduction of gray matter in patients. These changes would affect the regions of pain and stress modulation, reinforcing the theory that FM is associated with hypersensitivity of pain pathways in the CNS35.

The neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D have also been described in some experiments, indicating a potential pharmacological value of analogs of 1.25 (OH)2D for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases34. In this context, both the reduced production of active vitamin D and the micronutrient deficiency of vitamin D may be associated with the pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of FM. Thus, supplementation with vitamin D has shown significant improvement of pain and functional capacity in patients with FM. For example, Bilal et al.36 observed that Pakistani patients with FM with vitamin D deficiency had a significant beneficial effect on their symptoms after replacement of vitamin D.

Similarly, Matthana11 established a strong association between low serum vitamin D levels and FM in Saudi women. They reported that after vitamin D supplementation, 42 out of 61 women showed significant improvement in pain and functional capacity. In addition, statistically significant data were found in relation to the other symptoms of FM, except cognitive symptoms.

The study by Olama et al.18 reported significant differences in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine between FM and control patients, with 30% of the FM patients presenting osteopenia and 8% presenting osteoporosis. Similarly, Al-Allaf et al.38 concluded that FM patients have a high propensity for poor bone health in the future because of their susceptibility to low vitamin D levels and poor lifestyle factors; therefore, these patients should be screened and supplemented.

Although vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with FM, it occurs more frequently in patients with anxiety and depression22. Accordingly, Velozo et al.21 observed that patients with FM and vitamin D deficiency are prone to depression.

Anxiety and depression are comorbidities often present in patients with FM and appear to be associated with reduced levels of serotonin. This central neurotransmitter is known to influence several behaviors, as well as physiological and cognitive functions39. Vitamin D receptors are found in the neurons, in the glia cells, and in the pituitary gland, however their exact function remains unknown. The distribution of vitamin D receptors suggests that vitamin D may also act in the same way as other neurosteroids40.

Two studies in this review17,21 found no correlation between low serum levels of 25-OHD and FM, although they observed significant associations between serum levels of parathyroid hormone and pain perception in vitamin D deficient patients. According to Okumus et al.17, their findings are in agreement with several studies reporting vitamin D deficiency in patients with musculoskeletal pain22,30,41,42,43.

Therefore, even though studies suggest an association between vitamin D levels and the presence of FM, it is difficult to confirm this hypothesis. We have to consider the limitations of studies such as the absence of control groups or the use of unhealthy controls; and the lack of adjustments for confounding factors related to vitamin D deficiency, such as body mass, sun exposure time, skin pigmentation and the use of medication and supplements. Additionally, the variability of the studied populations (ethnicity, latitude of the location of the study) alongside small samples, different definitions for vitamin deficiency and different cut-off points of plasma levels of vitamin D (usually <20 ng/mL) make difficult the comparisons between studies and the validation of external results. Despite that, there seems to be an association between vitamin D deficiency and increased pain sensitivity, which is a symptom characteristic of FM.

II. Mineral Deficiency and Fibromyalgia

The association between FM development and mineral deficiency has been investigated. For example, Romano and Stiller44 indicated that Mg participates in ATP synthesis and it is important for muscle metabolism, thus its reduction would contribute to the progression of FM. The serum levels of selenium (Se) in FM patients were lower compared to their controls of the same age and sex45. In a recent study, Seferoglu et al.46 noted that the Se levels were lower the serum of patients with FM than in healthy controls, though the serum levels of Cu, Zn and Mg were normal in controls. Furthermore, they observed a significant correlation between Se levels, the duration of the disease, pain severity and the number of “tender points”.

In this review, only two studies observed a positive correlation between mineral deficiency and the presence of FM13,24. Among the assessed minerals, evidence was found only for Ca, Fe, Mg, Zn, Mn and Cu deficiencies. Besides mineral deficiency, the authors also sought to identify a correlation between possible toxic levels of trace elements in FM development and clinical signs such as pain, fatigue, functional capacity and other symptoms associated with FM.

The studies by Sendur et al.24 and Kim et al.13 indicated that serum Mg levels were lower in FM patients than in their controls, and there was a strong association between serum levels of Mg and fatigue.

According to Abraham et al.47 and Romano and Stiller44, Mg deficiency can lead to significant reductions in muscle ATP levels, and may play an important role in the development of FM. As Mg levels decrease, energy levels also decrease, resulting in an increased sensation of fatigue24. In an intervention study where patients with FM were treated with Mg citrate, low Mg levels correlated with pain intensity, number of tender points, functional capacity, depression and anxiety as well as with fatigue, sleep disturbances, headache and gastric disorders48. Other studies49,50 also demonstrated a correlation between Mg and clinical symptoms of FM, reinforcing that Mg plays an important role in the development of this syndrome.

The association between serum Zn levels and the number of tender points in patients with FM was found by Sendur et al.24. Similarly, Eisinger51 found low Zn levels in patients with FM. The importance of Zn to counteract oxidative stress has been related to its participation as a cofactor for many antioxidant enzymes51,52,53. It should also be pointed out that the imbalance of antioxidant enzymes plays an important role in the etiology of FM54.

Regarding Ca deficiency, a positive association was reported between Ca levels in the hair of women with FM13. The authors also pointed out that most patients with muscle pain, including FM, showed normal serum Ca levels but that intracellular Ca concentration can be different and should be investigated. According to Magaldi et al.55, intracellular Ca levels in patients with FM are lower when compared to healthy controls and may potentially be responsible for muscle hypertonus, which would explain muscle pain related to the symptoms of FM.

Only one study identified low Mn levels in FM patients15. However, recent studies reported that alterations in the balance between oxidants and antioxidants may be associated with the presence of FM48,54. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase 2, which contains Mn in its composition, play an important role in antioxidant defense inside the mitochondria56. In this sense, considering that the oxidant-antioxidant balance may be altered in patients with FM, Mn deficiency could be related to the pathophysiology of FM.

Iron deficiency has also been associated with clinical symptoms of FM. An increase in the prevalence of FM in patients with anemia due to Fe deficiency has been reported57. However, it has been suggested that the presence of anemia cannot explain the clinical manifestations of FM, since both the symptoms and the serum Fe levels do not differ between patients with FM and Fe deficiency anemia, and patients without FM. Thus, Fe deficiency without anemia has also been linked to the presence of FM, and Fe supplementation in such condition attenuated fatigue and improved cognitive and physical states58,59.

The study by Mader et al.23 evaluated the association between serum Fe, ferritin, transferritin and FM, but found no significant reduction in these markers in the blood of patients with FM. However, a study by Kim et al.13 reported significant reductions in Fe levels in the hair of FM patients, although comparisons of this result with those from serum levels cannot be made. This limitation makes it difficult to validate their results.

Thus, the number of studies on the influence of mineral deficiency in the pathophysiology of FM is still limited and the results are controversial. Observational studies also find it difficult to adjust all confounding factors related to the status of minerals in the body. Serum levels of trace elements in the body seem to vary constantly in a dynamic environment influenced by hormonal factors, environment, eating habits and others.

Finally, factors related to the study designs including duration, characteristics and sample size also hinder comparisons among studies and extrapolation of results. However, some minerals such as Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe and Mn appear to be associated with some of the most common clinical signs of FM (i.e. fatigue, weakness and pain), and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS

The positive association between vitamin D deficiency and increased pain sensitivity characteristic of FM is suggested, although such vitamin insufficiency is also associated with other chronic musculoskeletal disorders.

It appears that mineral deficiency (e.g., Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn and Ca) plays an important role in the onset of FM and its main symptoms. For instance, Mg and Fe deficiency is associated with fatigue, weakness and cognitive impairments. In addition, lower intracellular Ca is linked to increased muscle tone and tension, and hence muscular aches. Moreover, Zn and Mn deficiencies are related to changes in the oxidative cellular balance.

Finally, intervention studies on the influence of “hidden hunger” or micronutrient deficiency on the etiology of FM are necessary. Such findings in the field of nutritional science would contribute to the creation of more efficient and low cost therapeutic strategies following the preventive therapeutic principle.
