5to INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM          OF THE INTERNATIONAL   FRUIT & VEGETABLES ALLIANCE (IFAVA). OCTOBER          15-17, 2006.



The International Fruit and Vegetable Alliance          (IFAVA) is an international non-profit and nongovernmental organization          which was incorporated in Canada in 2005. Current membership includes:          Australia (Go for 2 & 5), Canada (5 to 10 a day), Mexico (5xdia),          USA (Produce for Better Health Foundation, Center for Disease Control,          National Cancer Institute), Denmark (6aday, Danish Cancer Society), France          (Aprifel), New Zealand (United Fresh) and South Africa (5-a-Day). New          members can join by visiting the website www.ifava.org.          

The IFAVA mission is to encourage and foster          efforts to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables for health.          IFAVA will meet its objectives by supporting national initiatives, promoting          efficiencies, sharing communication and resources, facilitating co-operation          on shared aims, acting as a clearinghouse for scientific findings and          providing global leadership through provision of sound scientific evidence.          

The objective of IFAVA is to gather as          many countries as possible to form a strong coalition that can stand united          to fight obesity and other diseases with a global strategy to increase          the consumption of fruit and vegetables. 

To meet the growing demand, IFAVA is organized          on two levels: the IFAVA Board of Directors will manage the overall operations          of the organization while two international committees have been formed          to focus on science and communications and will support the core tactics          of the IFAVA strategic plan. As well, the creation of a monthly scientific          newsletter will enable the not-for-profit organization to provide the          global scientific community with access to credible, sound scientific          evidence specific to vegetables and fruit. 

One of the key responsibilities is the          development and delivery of the bi-annual International Symposium, an          event to bring together 5 a day type programs and countries to discuss          and share information on how to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables.          

The purpose of the 5th International event          is to create a forum for representatives from the health, education, government          and business sectors worldwide. Through these stakeholders the aim is          to inspire and revolutionize global and national promotions to increase          the consumption of fruit and vegetables around the world for the prevention          of chronic disease and the promotion of better health. This is achieved          through programs and sessions which will: 

• Provide regional highlights from          innovative 5 a day type programs from around the world. 

• Expand global understanding on the          science and research behind the fruit and vegetable message. 

• Discuss ways that public policy          can drive innovation in research and applications. 

• Assist countries in establishing          and improving public-private partnerships to increase consumption of fruit          and vegetables to promote health. 

• Provide a forum for showcasing research          studies from different parts of the world related to fruit and vegetables          and their effect on health.
