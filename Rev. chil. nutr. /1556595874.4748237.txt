  RESUMEN Objetivo: Evaluar el efecto de una intervención    nutricional sobre el estado clínico y el pronóstico de pacientes con insuficiencia    cardiaca (IC). Métodos: Doscientos tres pacientes con IC fueron aleatorizados    al grupo con intervención (GI, n=84) o al control (GC, n=119) y seguidos por    12 meses. El GI recibió una dieta con restricción de sodio (2000 a 2400 mg/d)    y líquidos (<1500 ml/d) y el GC recomendaciones nutricionales generales.    Se evaluó la composición corporal, el estado clínico, hospitalizaciones y sobrevida.    Resultados: Al término del seguimiento, la excreción urinaria de sodio disminuyó    16,4% en el GI vs. un aumento de 8,8% en el GC (p<0,05). El agua extracellular    disminuyó 1,4% en el GI vs. 1,2% de aumento en el GC (p=0,03). Asimismo, el    porcentaje de reducción de fatiga fue significativo para el GI, no así para    el GC; también se observó, entre los pacientes con IC sistólica, un aumento    significativamente mayor en la fracción de expulsión para el GI vs. CG (49,6%    vs. 5,0%, p=0,001). El número de hospitalizaciones y el tiempo de sobrevida    tuvieron una tendencia a ser mejor en el GI. Conclusión: Una intervención nutricional    con restricción de sodio y líquidos mostró tener un impacto favorable en el    estado clínico de pacientes con IC.

INTRODUCTION The primary nutritional strategies in patients    with heart failure (HF) are to accomplish and maintain a good nutritional status    with less cardiac stress, and to decrease or prevent sodium and fluid retention    in addition to correct cardiac cachexia syndrome or limit its severity. In this    sense, the specific recommendations are focused on sodium and fluid restrictions    and weight optimization to prevent cardiac descompensation and subsequent hospitalizations    in order to decrease hospitalization costs and improve the patient's quality    of life. In addition, considering the high prevalence of coronary disease as    a cause of HF, it is necessary to decrease intakes of saturated lipids, cholesterol,    and simple carbohydrates (1-3). Dietary sodium intake has become the target for    exogenous modulation as facilitated by nutrition prescription. Because of this    awareness of the importance of sodium balance in HF, it has been presumed based    on empiric knowledge that reducing exogenous sodium intake in an overtly fluid    overloaded state would be an appropriate intervention (4). Both, the American College of Cardiology and    American Heart Association (5) and the European Society of Cardiology (6) guidelines    for the evaluation and management of patients with HF recommend sodium restriction    (2000 mg daily) in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF who have evidence    of fluid retention and fluid restriction (<2 liters per day) may be considered    in those with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction    and high-dose diuretics, especially with hyponatremia. However, few randomized,    controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate specific recommendations related    to these restrictions and its long time clinical effects, showing controversial    results (7-9). Indeed, the current level of evidence for these recommendations    remains being C, based on expert opinión. Moreover, the most available studies in HF patients    are focused to restrict only sodium and/or fluids, leaving outside macronutrients    consumption (7,8,10). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate    the effects of a nutritional intervention focused on the improvement of clinical    status and the prognosis of heart failure patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS  Patients This 12-months randomized controlled trial inclu-ded    203 male and female patients who attended the Heart Failure Clinic at the "Instituto    Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán" (INCMNSZ) in México    City. Patients were recruited if they were 18 years or older, with confirmed    diagnosis of HF (defined as decreased systolic and/or diastolic) function as    determined by echocardiogram) (5). Subjects were excluded if they already had    a specific dietary regimen, renal failure, uncontrolled dysthyroidism, hepatic    failure, unstable ischemic heart disease (unstable angina and/or myocardial    infarction), recent myocardial revascularization procedures (arterial coronary    angioplasty and/ or surgical revascularization in the previous 3 months), severe    arrhythmias, HF secondary to chemotherapy, suspicion of malignancy, or limb    amputations. The present study was approved by the institutional    ethics committee of biomedical research in humans of the INCMNSZ, and all patients    were informed regarding the purpose of the study and signed informed consent    forms. Management protocol Subjects were randomized to intervention group    (IG, n=84), or control group (CG, n=119). Procedure was blinded to the cardiologist    who evaluated the clinical status of patients and to the nutritionist who conducted    the anthropometric and body composition evaluations. In addition to HF conventional pharmacological    treatment, an isocaloric salt-restricted diet was prescribed to patients in    the intervention group (2000 to 2400 mg/d of sodium) and composed as follow:    of total calories, 50-55% of carbohydrates (with a preference for complex carbohydrates and fiber), 0,8 g of protein    per kg body weight per day, 30-35 % of total lipids (<10% saturated, 10%    polyunsaturated, 15% monounsaturated, and <300 mg/d of cholesterol). Total    fluids were limited to 1,5 L/d, including the water in food. These patients    received written and oral instructions from the dietitian and were advised to    avoid sodium-rich food, limit the intake of food with moderate amounts of sodium,    and eat no more than one-fourth a teaspoon of salt per day. Adherence to diet    was evaluated by a 24-hours food recall collected every 2 months, and suggestions    and corrections were provided, when necessary. Patients in the control group received conventional    pharmacological treatment for HF as well as common dietary oral advisories by    the cardiologist regarding decreased sodium and fluid intakes, as it is recommended    by the guidelines (5, 6) for the evaluation and management of patients with    HF. Anthropometric variables, body composition, dietary    intake, metabolic, and clinical evaluations were performed on all patients at    baseline and 12 months. Measurements Anthropometry and body composition. Weight    and height were measured according to the reference manual of anthropometric    standardization (11), and all subjects wore little clothing and were barefoot.    Body mass index was calculated by dividing total body weight (kilograms) by    height squared (square meters). Body composition was evaluated with tetrapolar    and multiple-frequencies equipment (BodyStat QuadScan 4000), and extracellular    water (ECW) was obtained. Dietary intake. Dietary intake data were    obtained by a 3-day food record. Nutrients obtained from a 3-day average of    food records were analyzed with a compu-terized nutrition datábase (SCVAN 1,0,    1993, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición SZ, México City, México),    which contains the nutritional valúes of Mexican food. Missing foods were added    by using the Mexican Food and Nutrient Valúes Tables (12). Sodium intake was    evaluated by twenty-four-hour uriñe samples, assuming that 24-hour urinary sodium    excretion is equi-valent to approximately 86% of the daily sodium intake, as    reported by Korhonen et al. (13). Biochemical analysis. Fasting blood samples    were analyzed for plasma concentrations of glucose, albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit,    triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and    low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Plasma glucose was enzymatically determined    with the glucose oxidase technique, and plasma concentrations of total cholesterol    and triglycerides were measured with an automated system (Synchron CX5, Beckman    Instruments). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was precipitated with phosphotungstic    acid and Mg2+, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated as follows:    total cholesterol - (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol + triglycerides/5).    We defined dyslipidemia as a total cholesterol level above 200 mg/ dL, a low-density    lipoprotein cholesterol level above 100 mg/dL, and/or a triglycerides level    above 150 mg/dL. Clinical Data. Symptoms such as fatigue,    dyspnea, edema, and functional class according the New York Heart Association    (NYHA) (14) were evaluated during the medical interview. Functional capacity    was measured in metabolic equivalents (METs, where one MET is 3,5 mL/kg per    min of oxygen consumption) with symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing,    conducted according to modified Bruce protocol (15). Also, all patients underwent    a transthoracic echocardiogram to determine ventricular function. Endpoints Primary endpoints (prognosis). Cardiovascular    hospitalizations (HF decompensate, cardiac arrhythmias, acute pulmonary embolism,    acute pulmonary edema, and acute coronary syndromes) and 12 months survival,    were primary endpoints. Secondary Endpoints. Decrease of symptoms    (edema, dyspnea or fatigue) expressed as percentage of decrease at the end of    the study respect to the baseline, and increase in physical effort achieved,    were considered secondary endpoints. Statistic analysis All analyses were performed with commercially    available software (SPSS 15,0 for Windows, SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous    variables are expressed as mean + standard deviation, and categorical variables    are presented as relative frequencies. For the baseline comparison between the    groups on continúes variables independent-sampies t was used and for categorical    variables X2. Changes observed at 12 months of follow-up on    continuous variables were presented as percentages of change respect to the    baseline. Percentages of change were compared between groups by Mann-Whitney    U test. Changes on categorical variables into each group were evaluated by Mac-Nemar    test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Log rank significance test was also    performed. For the analysis of the study variables, excepting    survival, patients that were lost to follow-up, for whom final measurements    were not available, and those who failed in adherence to diet were not included.    For the survival analysis, only non-adherence patients were eliminated. RESULTS Of the 203 patients included in the present study    (IG=84 y CG=119), ten were lost to follow-up, four died, and eight were eliminated    from the intervention group due to non-adherence to the diet. In the control    group, thirteen were lost to follow-up and 12 died (figure    1).    

Baseline Baseline characteristics by group are listed    in table 1. Fatigue was more frequent in the IG and functional    capacity achieved was worse for this same group. At the beginning of the study    all patients were taking two or more of the following drugs administrated at    high-dose according to patient tolerance: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting    enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, digitalis,    oral nitrates and aldosterone receptor antagonists.    

For the evaluation of cardiac function patients    were divided into systolic and diastolic heart failure groups. Among systolic    heart failure patients it was observed a lower mean ejection fraction for the    IG. There were not significant differences between groups in diastolic heart    failure subjects (table 2).    

Mean nutrient intake at baseline was similar    between groups (data not shown). Follow-up At the end of the study, there were no significant    differences in the anthropometric variables (weight and BMI) between the two    groups, unlike body composition parameters, where the percentage change of extracellular    water decreased in the intervention group and increased in the controls (-1,4±5,0    vs. 1,2±4,4%; p=0,03). Regar-ding biochemical parameters, hematocrit    showed a significant increase in the IG in comparison with a decrease in the    CG (2,0+7,3 vs. -3,3+8,4%; p=0,04) (table 3).    

Mean changes in dietary intake between groups    are shown in table 4. Calories consumption increased in both    groups without significant differences between them, and total lipids intake    diminished in the intervention group as much as in the control. However, dietary    cholesterol consumption showed a significant difference between groups, with    an important decrease in the intervention subjects in comparison with an increase    in the controls. In addition, saturated fatty acids and fluids intakes decrease    in the IG more than in the CG. Also, calcium consumption adjusted by caloric    intake significantly decreased among intervention subjects in comparison with    an increase in the controls.    

Mean sodium intake showed an increase in both    groups at the end of the study, however, these data did not account for the    salt used in cooking, which represents a major component of salt intake in this    population. For that reason, urinary sodium excretion was determined and a significant    difference between groups for the chan-gepercentage was observed (-16,4±13,7    vs. 8,8±46,5%, p<0,05, for IG and CG, respectively). The mean urinary    sodium excretion at the end of the study corresponded to 1360±398 mg/dL    in the IG and 2357±1202 mg/dL in the CG. At the end of the study, decrease percentage    of fatigue was significant and higher in the intervention (52,9%, p=0,02) that    in the control group (46,4%, p=NS). Presence of edema decreased 68% in the IG    and 40% in the CG; these differences were not statistically significant. Dyspnea    did not show significant differences for any group. In the IG, decrease in fatigue was concordant    with the observed one in the METs of activity achieved. Mean change percentage    for METs registered showed a trend to increase in the IG vs. CG (39,6+60,0 vs.    -7,9+34,7%; p=0,08). N YH A functional class improved significantly in both    groups at the end of the study.  The impact of the diet on cardiac function was    evaluated by heart failure group. In this sense, the improvement on dietary    profile (specifically the decrease in sodium and fluids intakes) had an impact    on cardiac function reflected as a statistically significant increase in the    ejection fraction for the IG vs. CG, among systolic HF subjects (percentages    of change, 49,6+53,5 vs. 5,0+19,8%; p=0,001). The other cardiac parameters did    not show significant differences. Among diastolic HF subjects, there were no    significant differences between study groups. It is important to emphasize that HF medication    was similar between groups during the follow-up (data not shown). Prognosis results Proportion of patients with at least one cardiovascular    hospitalization during follow-up was lower in the IG vs. CG (11,1 vs. 15,7%;    p=0,3); however, this difference was not statistically significant. In addition,    survival showed a trend to be better among intervention patients, since one-year    cumulative probability of survival among subjects with intervention was 93,7%    vs. 88,1% in the CG (figure 2). Of the four deaths registered    in the CG and of the 12 in the CG, 2 (50%) and 8 (66.7%) were cardiovascular    deaths, respectively.    

DISCUSSION The present study showed the favorable influence    of a nutritional intervention with restriction of sodium (<2400 mg/d) and    liquid (<1500 ml/d) as part of non-pharmacological treatment in stable systolic    and diastolic heart failure patient (NYHA TIII), with improvement in clinical    status (decrease of fatigue and better functional capacity) and cardiac function    (improved ejection fraction). Indeed, prognosis was better for patients receiving    this nutritional intervention, although differences were not statistically significant.    The lack of significance could be explained, in part, because of the few events    (deaths) observed in both groups and its repercussion on statistical power. At the end of the study, IG had a higher decrease    in liquid intake. Also, urinary sodium excretion, that evaluates indirectly    the dietary sodium consumption, showed a significant decrease in the IG vs.    CG, obtaining a final mean sodium excretion of 13 60 mg/dL for IG and 2357 mg/dL    for CG; this suggest a sodium intake of 1581 mg/d and 2740 mg/d, for each group    respectively, considering that excretion represents approximately 86% of ingestión. The sodium and fluid intake can greatly assist    in the maintenance of volume balance in HF patients (16). This was confirmed    in the present study through the decrease in urinary sodium and ECW and an increase    in hemat-crit, even without significant decrease in weight. Beich et al. (4)    suggest that to optimize sodium consumption earlier in the course of the HF    syndrome could prevent the cardio-renal syndrome, perhaps by limiting diuretic    use which may avert the occurrence of this syndrome. Also, it is important to    emphasize that findings in this study suggest that a routine body composition    eva-luation by the bioelectrical impedance method could be particularly useful    to detect fluid overload in the early stages of fluid retention, before apparent    edema appears, and to allow the clinician to modify diuretics prescription,    thereby avoiding functional deterioration, progression of structural abnormalities,    and worsening the quality of life. Likewise, in these study patients that received    nutritional intervention additional to the significant decrease in ECW at the    end of the follow-up, they also had a decrease in fatigue, corroborated by an    increase in functional capacity (METs). These fmdings can be explained by Chomsky    et al. study (17) which suggests that heart failure patients with volume overloud,    even without clinical evidence (edema), frequently have higher intracardiac    diastolic pressures, and that after removal of this subclinical fluid excess,    exercise tolerance improves. Although the positive results of the present study,    other studies suggest that is possible that a strict low-sodium diet is not    warranted in euvolemic compensated HF patients who are on appropriate evidence-based    therapy (4). In one of these studies, Alvelos et al. (7) attempted to determine    whether sodium restriction was therapeutic in patients assessed to have mild-to    moderate compensated systolic HF. For this purpose, 24 patients with mild-to-moderate    chronic HF were studied, 12 consumed 100 mmol (2300 mg) sodium daily and 12    continued their usual-salt diet (controls) where sodium intake was not restricted    or quantified, during a 15-day period. The findings were that the lower-sodium-intake    group had lower blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion, and more weight    loss (fluid loss) than the normal sodium group. They also had lower B-type natriuretic    peptide (BNP), an indirect marker of heart function, which increases with higher    left ventricular volume and pressure. However, volume depletion induced by the    low-sodium diet led to an activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone    systems. Dopamine synthesis was increased probably as a counter-regulatory mechanism.    The activation of these vasoconstrictors, antinatriuretic, and antidiuretic    systems may had induced a reduction in renal blood flow leading to an increase    in renal sodium and water reabsorption and overall worsening of the neurohumoral    steady state. It is important to mention that all of these euvolemic patients    were taking furosemide (mean dose 86,7±11,9 mg/d). On the other side, Paterna et al. (8) compared    hospital readmission rates for HF patients based on consumption of a normal-sodium    diet (120 mmol or 2760 mg daily) or a "low-sodium" diet (80 mmol or 1840 mg    daily). The study consisted of 232 compensated HF patients divided into 2 groups    based on prescribed diet, all taking high-dose oral furosemide (250-500 mg,    twice a day) and restricting fluid to 1000 mi per day. The normal-sodium group    had a lower incidence of hospital readmissions and mortality compared with the    low-sodium group. Serum aldosterone and renin levéis were significantly higher    in the "low-sodium" group at follow-up, indicating an increase in neurohormonal    activation. However, BNP was significantly lower at 90 and 180 days of follow-up    in the normal-sodium group. The differences between the findings of those studies    and ours, regarding fluid balance perhaps are due to the high doses of loop    diuretics used by them. So that, as Beich and Yancy stated (4), it would be    necessary an individualized sodium prescription calculated based on such factors    as disease risk, activity level, energy needs, renal and cardiac function, volume    status, medication effects, fluid intake and output. The intervention group had better survival and    less cardiovascular hospitalizations compared with the control group. Although    these differences were not sta-tistically significant, the significant increase    of ejection fraction among patients with systolic heart failure in the IG could    suggests a better prognosis in these patients, because ejection fraction has    been recognized as one of the most important independent prognostic marker inHF(16,    18). Additional to the decrease in cholesterol and    sa-turated fatty acids intake in the IG, also it was found a reduction in calcium    intake. This could be in accordance with result of the study of Arcand et al.    (19), they found in stable heart failure patients inadequacies of certain vitamins    and minerals like calcium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins D and E, related    to a not excessive sodium intake. These fmdings highlight the importance of    diet beyond that of sodium restnction. STUDY LIMITATIONS This study has two important limitations: first,    patients in NYHA functional class IV were not included, in whom the prognosis    is different and the effect of the nutritional intervention could be different;    and second, there were lost of cases during follow-up and the statistical analysis    included only the patients that had adherence to diet. Thus, the applicability    of our fmdings to other patients with heart failure requires further studies. CONCLUSION In conclusion, a nutritional intervention with    intake restnction of sodium (<2400 mg/day) and fluid less than 1500 ml/day    had positive effects in stable systolic and diastolic heart failure patients    after one year of follow-up, like decrease in extracellular water and fatigue,    as well as an increase in hematocrit. Also, in systolic heart failure patients,    left ventricular function improved even the better prognosis was not statically    significant.   BIBLIOGRAFÍA 1.

    INTRODUCTION The primary nutritional strategies in patients    with heart failure (HF) are to accomplish and maintain a good nutritional status    with less cardiac stress, and to decrease or prevent sodium and fluid retention    in addition to correct cardiac cachexia syndrome or limit its severity. In this    sense, the specific recommendations are focused on sodium and fluid restrictions    and weight optimization to prevent cardiac descompensation and subsequent hospitalizations    in order to decrease hospitalization costs and improve the patient's quality    of life. In addition, considering the high prevalence of coronary disease as    a cause of HF, it is necessary to decrease intakes of saturated lipids, cholesterol,    and simple carbohydrates (1-3). Dietary sodium intake has become the target for    exogenous modulation as facilitated by nutrition prescription. Because of this    awareness of the importance of sodium balance in HF, it has been presumed based    on empiric knowledge that reducing exogenous sodium intake in an overtly fluid    overloaded state would be an appropriate intervention (4). Both, the American College of Cardiology and    American Heart Association (5) and the European Society of Cardiology (6) guidelines    for the evaluation and management of patients with HF recommend sodium restriction    (2000 mg daily) in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF who have evidence    of fluid retention and fluid restriction (<2 liters per day) may be considered    in those with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction    and high-dose diuretics, especially with hyponatremia. However, few randomized,    controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate specific recommendations related    to these restrictions and its long time clinical effects, showing controversial    results (7-9). Indeed, the current level of evidence for these recommendations    remains being C, based on expert opinión. Moreover, the most available studies in HF patients    are focused to restrict only sodium and/or fluids, leaving outside macronutrients    consumption (7,8,10). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate    the effects of a nutritional intervention focused on the improvement of clinical    status and the prognosis of heart failure patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS  Patients This 12-months randomized controlled trial inclu-ded    203 male and female patients who attended the Heart Failure Clinic at the "Instituto    Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán" (INCMNSZ) in México    City. Patients were recruited if they were 18 years or older, with confirmed    diagnosis of HF (defined as decreased systolic and/or diastolic) function as    determined by echocardiogram) (5). Subjects were excluded if they already had    a specific dietary regimen, renal failure, uncontrolled dysthyroidism, hepatic    failure, unstable ischemic heart disease (unstable angina and/or myocardial    infarction), recent myocardial revascularization procedures (arterial coronary    angioplasty and/ or surgical revascularization in the previous 3 months), severe    arrhythmias, HF secondary to chemotherapy, suspicion of malignancy, or limb    amputations. The present study was approved by the institutional    ethics committee of biomedical research in humans of the INCMNSZ, and all patients    were informed regarding the purpose of the study and signed informed consent    forms. Management protocol Subjects were randomized to intervention group    (IG, n=84), or control group (CG, n=119). Procedure was blinded to the cardiologist    who evaluated the clinical status of patients and to the nutritionist who conducted    the anthropometric and body composition evaluations. In addition to HF conventional pharmacological    treatment, an isocaloric salt-restricted diet was prescribed to patients in    the intervention group (2000 to 2400 mg/d of sodium) and composed as follow:    of total calories, 50-55% of carbohydrates (with a preference for complex carbohydrates and fiber), 0,8 g of protein    per kg body weight per day, 30-35 % of total lipids (<10% saturated, 10%    polyunsaturated, 15% monounsaturated, and <300 mg/d of cholesterol). Total    fluids were limited to 1,5 L/d, including the water in food. These patients    received written and oral instructions from the dietitian and were advised to    avoid sodium-rich food, limit the intake of food with moderate amounts of sodium,    and eat no more than one-fourth a teaspoon of salt per day. Adherence to diet    was evaluated by a 24-hours food recall collected every 2 months, and suggestions    and corrections were provided, when necessary. Patients in the control group received conventional    pharmacological treatment for HF as well as common dietary oral advisories by    the cardiologist regarding decreased sodium and fluid intakes, as it is recommended    by the guidelines (5, 6) for the evaluation and management of patients with    HF. Anthropometric variables, body composition, dietary    intake, metabolic, and clinical evaluations were performed on all patients at    baseline and 12 months. Measurements Anthropometry and body composition. Weight    and height were measured according to the reference manual of anthropometric    standardization (11), and all subjects wore little clothing and were barefoot.    Body mass index was calculated by dividing total body weight (kilograms) by    height squared (square meters). Body composition was evaluated with tetrapolar    and multiple-frequencies equipment (BodyStat QuadScan 4000), and extracellular    water (ECW) was obtained. Dietary intake. Dietary intake data were    obtained by a 3-day food record. Nutrients obtained from a 3-day average of    food records were analyzed with a compu-terized nutrition datábase (SCVAN 1,0,    1993, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición SZ, México City, México),    which contains the nutritional valúes of Mexican food. Missing foods were added    by using the Mexican Food and Nutrient Valúes Tables (12). Sodium intake was    evaluated by twenty-four-hour uriñe samples, assuming that 24-hour urinary sodium    excretion is equi-valent to approximately 86% of the daily sodium intake, as    reported by Korhonen et al. (13). Biochemical analysis. Fasting blood samples    were analyzed for plasma concentrations of glucose, albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit,    triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and    low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Plasma glucose was enzymatically determined    with the glucose oxidase technique, and plasma concentrations of total cholesterol    and triglycerides were measured with an automated system (Synchron CX5, Beckman    Instruments). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was precipitated with phosphotungstic    acid and Mg2+, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated as follows:    total cholesterol - (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol + triglycerides/5).    We defined dyslipidemia as a total cholesterol level above 200 mg/ dL, a low-density    lipoprotein cholesterol level above 100 mg/dL, and/or a triglycerides level    above 150 mg/dL. Clinical Data. Symptoms such as fatigue,    dyspnea, edema, and functional class according the New York Heart Association    (NYHA) (14) were evaluated during the medical interview. Functional capacity    was measured in metabolic equivalents (METs, where one MET is 3,5 mL/kg per    min of oxygen consumption) with symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing,    conducted according to modified Bruce protocol (15). Also, all patients underwent    a transthoracic echocardiogram to determine ventricular function. Endpoints Primary endpoints (prognosis). Cardiovascular    hospitalizations (HF decompensate, cardiac arrhythmias, acute pulmonary embolism,    acute pulmonary edema, and acute coronary syndromes) and 12 months survival,    were primary endpoints. Secondary Endpoints. Decrease of symptoms    (edema, dyspnea or fatigue) expressed as percentage of decrease at the end of    the study respect to the baseline, and increase in physical effort achieved,    were considered secondary endpoints. Statistic analysis All analyses were performed with commercially    available software (SPSS 15,0 for Windows, SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous    variables are expressed as mean + standard deviation, and categorical variables    are presented as relative frequencies. For the baseline comparison between the    groups on continúes variables independent-sampies t was used and for categorical    variables X2. Changes observed at 12 months of follow-up on    continuous variables were presented as percentages of change respect to the    baseline. Percentages of change were compared between groups by Mann-Whitney    U test. Changes on categorical variables into each group were evaluated by Mac-Nemar    test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Log rank significance test was also    performed. For the analysis of the study variables, excepting    survival, patients that were lost to follow-up, for whom final measurements    were not available, and those who failed in adherence to diet were not included.    For the survival analysis, only non-adherence patients were eliminated. RESULTS Of the 203 patients included in the present study    (IG=84 y CG=119), ten were lost to follow-up, four died, and eight were eliminated    from the intervention group due to non-adherence to the diet. In the control    group, thirteen were lost to follow-up and 12 died (figure    1).    

Baseline Baseline characteristics by group are listed    in table 1. Fatigue was more frequent in the IG and functional    capacity achieved was worse for this same group. At the beginning of the study    all patients were taking two or more of the following drugs administrated at    high-dose according to patient tolerance: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting    enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, digitalis,    oral nitrates and aldosterone receptor antagonists.    

For the evaluation of cardiac function patients    were divided into systolic and diastolic heart failure groups. Among systolic    heart failure patients it was observed a lower mean ejection fraction for the    IG. There were not significant differences between groups in diastolic heart    failure subjects (table 2).    

Mean nutrient intake at baseline was similar    between groups (data not shown). Follow-up At the end of the study, there were no significant    differences in the anthropometric variables (weight and BMI) between the two    groups, unlike body composition parameters, where the percentage change of extracellular    water decreased in the intervention group and increased in the controls (-1,4±5,0    vs. 1,2±4,4%; p=0,03). Regar-ding biochemical parameters, hematocrit    showed a significant increase in the IG in comparison with a decrease in the    CG (2,0+7,3 vs. -3,3+8,4%; p=0,04) (table 3).    

Mean changes in dietary intake between groups    are shown in table 4. Calories consumption increased in both    groups without significant differences between them, and total lipids intake    diminished in the intervention group as much as in the control. However, dietary    cholesterol consumption showed a significant difference between groups, with    an important decrease in the intervention subjects in comparison with an increase    in the controls. In addition, saturated fatty acids and fluids intakes decrease    in the IG more than in the CG. Also, calcium consumption adjusted by caloric    intake significantly decreased among intervention subjects in comparison with    an increase in the controls.    

Mean sodium intake showed an increase in both    groups at the end of the study, however, these data did not account for the    salt used in cooking, which represents a major component of salt intake in this    population. For that reason, urinary sodium excretion was determined and a significant    difference between groups for the chan-gepercentage was observed (-16,4±13,7    vs. 8,8±46,5%, p<0,05, for IG and CG, respectively). The mean urinary    sodium excretion at the end of the study corresponded to 1360±398 mg/dL    in the IG and 2357±1202 mg/dL in the CG. At the end of the study, decrease percentage    of fatigue was significant and higher in the intervention (52,9%, p=0,02) that    in the control group (46,4%, p=NS). Presence of edema decreased 68% in the IG    and 40% in the CG; these differences were not statistically significant. Dyspnea    did not show significant differences for any group. In the IG, decrease in fatigue was concordant    with the observed one in the METs of activity achieved. Mean change percentage    for METs registered showed a trend to increase in the IG vs. CG (39,6+60,0 vs.    -7,9+34,7%; p=0,08). N YH A functional class improved significantly in both    groups at the end of the study.  The impact of the diet on cardiac function was    evaluated by heart failure group. In this sense, the improvement on dietary    profile (specifically the decrease in sodium and fluids intakes) had an impact    on cardiac function reflected as a statistically significant increase in the    ejection fraction for the IG vs. CG, among systolic HF subjects (percentages    of change, 49,6+53,5 vs. 5,0+19,8%; p=0,001). The other cardiac parameters did    not show significant differences. Among diastolic HF subjects, there were no    significant differences between study groups. It is important to emphasize that HF medication    was similar between groups during the follow-up (data not shown). Prognosis results Proportion of patients with at least one cardiovascular    hospitalization during follow-up was lower in the IG vs. CG (11,1 vs. 15,7%;    p=0,3); however, this difference was not statistically significant. In addition,    survival showed a trend to be better among intervention patients, since one-year    cumulative probability of survival among subjects with intervention was 93,7%    vs. 88,1% in the CG (figure 2). Of the four deaths registered    in the CG and of the 12 in the CG, 2 (50%) and 8 (66.7%) were cardiovascular    deaths, respectively.    

DISCUSSION The present study showed the favorable influence    of a nutritional intervention with restriction of sodium (<2400 mg/d) and    liquid (<1500 ml/d) as part of non-pharmacological treatment in stable systolic    and diastolic heart failure patient (NYHA TIII), with improvement in clinical    status (decrease of fatigue and better functional capacity) and cardiac function    (improved ejection fraction). Indeed, prognosis was better for patients receiving    this nutritional intervention, although differences were not statistically significant.    The lack of significance could be explained, in part, because of the few events    (deaths) observed in both groups and its repercussion on statistical power. At the end of the study, IG had a higher decrease    in liquid intake. Also, urinary sodium excretion, that evaluates indirectly    the dietary sodium consumption, showed a significant decrease in the IG vs.    CG, obtaining a final mean sodium excretion of 13 60 mg/dL for IG and 2357 mg/dL    for CG; this suggest a sodium intake of 1581 mg/d and 2740 mg/d, for each group    respectively, considering that excretion represents approximately 86% of ingestión. The sodium and fluid intake can greatly assist    in the maintenance of volume balance in HF patients (16). This was confirmed    in the present study through the decrease in urinary sodium and ECW and an increase    in hemat-crit, even without significant decrease in weight. Beich et al. (4)    suggest that to optimize sodium consumption earlier in the course of the HF    syndrome could prevent the cardio-renal syndrome, perhaps by limiting diuretic    use which may avert the occurrence of this syndrome. Also, it is important to    emphasize that findings in this study suggest that a routine body composition    eva-luation by the bioelectrical impedance method could be particularly useful    to detect fluid overload in the early stages of fluid retention, before apparent    edema appears, and to allow the clinician to modify diuretics prescription,    thereby avoiding functional deterioration, progression of structural abnormalities,    and worsening the quality of life. Likewise, in these study patients that received    nutritional intervention additional to the significant decrease in ECW at the    end of the follow-up, they also had a decrease in fatigue, corroborated by an    increase in functional capacity (METs). These fmdings can be explained by Chomsky    et al. study (17) which suggests that heart failure patients with volume overloud,    even without clinical evidence (edema), frequently have higher intracardiac    diastolic pressures, and that after removal of this subclinical fluid excess,    exercise tolerance improves. Although the positive results of the present study,    other studies suggest that is possible that a strict low-sodium diet is not    warranted in euvolemic compensated HF patients who are on appropriate evidence-based    therapy (4). In one of these studies, Alvelos et al. (7) attempted to determine    whether sodium restriction was therapeutic in patients assessed to have mild-to    moderate compensated systolic HF. For this purpose, 24 patients with mild-to-moderate    chronic HF were studied, 12 consumed 100 mmol (2300 mg) sodium daily and 12    continued their usual-salt diet (controls) where sodium intake was not restricted    or quantified, during a 15-day period. The findings were that the lower-sodium-intake    group had lower blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion, and more weight    loss (fluid loss) than the normal sodium group. They also had lower B-type natriuretic    peptide (BNP), an indirect marker of heart function, which increases with higher    left ventricular volume and pressure. However, volume depletion induced by the    low-sodium diet led to an activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone    systems. Dopamine synthesis was increased probably as a counter-regulatory mechanism.    The activation of these vasoconstrictors, antinatriuretic, and antidiuretic    systems may had induced a reduction in renal blood flow leading to an increase    in renal sodium and water reabsorption and overall worsening of the neurohumoral    steady state. It is important to mention that all of these euvolemic patients    were taking furosemide (mean dose 86,7±11,9 mg/d). On the other side, Paterna et al. (8) compared    hospital readmission rates for HF patients based on consumption of a normal-sodium    diet (120 mmol or 2760 mg daily) or a "low-sodium" diet (80 mmol or 1840 mg    daily). The study consisted of 232 compensated HF patients divided into 2 groups    based on prescribed diet, all taking high-dose oral furosemide (250-500 mg,    twice a day) and restricting fluid to 1000 mi per day. The normal-sodium group    had a lower incidence of hospital readmissions and mortality compared with the    low-sodium group. Serum aldosterone and renin levéis were significantly higher    in the "low-sodium" group at follow-up, indicating an increase in neurohormonal    activation. However, BNP was significantly lower at 90 and 180 days of follow-up    in the normal-sodium group. The differences between the findings of those studies    and ours, regarding fluid balance perhaps are due to the high doses of loop    diuretics used by them. So that, as Beich and Yancy stated (4), it would be    necessary an individualized sodium prescription calculated based on such factors    as disease risk, activity level, energy needs, renal and cardiac function, volume    status, medication effects, fluid intake and output. The intervention group had better survival and    less cardiovascular hospitalizations compared with the control group. Although    these differences were not sta-tistically significant, the significant increase    of ejection fraction among patients with systolic heart failure in the IG could    suggests a better prognosis in these patients, because ejection fraction has    been recognized as one of the most important independent prognostic marker inHF(16,    18). Additional to the decrease in cholesterol and    sa-turated fatty acids intake in the IG, also it was found a reduction in calcium    intake. This could be in accordance with result of the study of Arcand et al.    (19), they found in stable heart failure patients inadequacies of certain vitamins    and minerals like calcium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins D and E, related    to a not excessive sodium intake. These fmdings highlight the importance of    diet beyond that of sodium restnction. STUDY LIMITATIONS This study has two important limitations: first,    patients in NYHA functional class IV were not included, in whom the prognosis    is different and the effect of the nutritional intervention could be different;    and second, there were lost of cases during follow-up and the statistical analysis    included only the patients that had adherence to diet. Thus, the applicability    of our fmdings to other patients with heart failure requires further studies. CONCLUSION In conclusion, a nutritional intervention with    intake restnction of sodium (<2400 mg/day) and fluid less than 1500 ml/day    had positive effects in stable systolic and diastolic heart failure patients    after one year of follow-up, like decrease in extracellular water and fatigue,    as well as an increase in hematocrit. Also, in systolic heart failure patients,    left ventricular function improved even the better prognosis was not statically    significant.   BIBLIOGRAFÍA 1.

INTRODUCTION

The primary nutritional strategies in patients    with heart failure (HF) are to accomplish and maintain a good nutritional status    with less cardiac stress, and to decrease or prevent sodium and fluid retention    in addition to correct cardiac cachexia syndrome or limit its severity. In this    sense, the specific recommendations are focused on sodium and fluid restrictions    and weight optimization to prevent cardiac descompensation and subsequent hospitalizations    in order to decrease hospitalization costs and improve the patient's quality    of life. In addition, considering the high prevalence of coronary disease as    a cause of HF, it is necessary to decrease intakes of saturated lipids, cholesterol,    and simple carbohydrates (1-3).

Dietary sodium intake has become the target for    exogenous modulation as facilitated by nutrition prescription. Because of this    awareness of the importance of sodium balance in HF, it has been presumed based    on empiric knowledge that reducing exogenous sodium intake in an overtly fluid    overloaded state would be an appropriate intervention (4).

Both, the American College of Cardiology and    American Heart Association (5) and the European Society of Cardiology (6) guidelines    for the evaluation and management of patients with HF recommend sodium restriction    (2000 mg daily) in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF who have evidence    of fluid retention and fluid restriction (<2 liters per day) may be considered    in those with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction    and high-dose diuretics, especially with hyponatremia. However, few randomized,    controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate specific recommendations related    to these restrictions and its long time clinical effects, showing controversial    results (7-9). Indeed, the current level of evidence for these recommendations    remains being C, based on expert opinión.

Moreover, the most available studies in HF patients    are focused to restrict only sodium and/or fluids, leaving outside macronutrients    consumption (7,8,10).

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate    the effects of a nutritional intervention focused on the improvement of clinical    status and the prognosis of heart failure patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Patients

This 12-months randomized controlled trial inclu-ded    203 male and female patients who attended the Heart Failure Clinic at the "Instituto    Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán" (INCMNSZ) in México    City. Patients were recruited if they were 18 years or older, with confirmed    diagnosis of HF (defined as decreased systolic and/or diastolic) function as    determined by echocardiogram) (5). Subjects were excluded if they already had    a specific dietary regimen, renal failure, uncontrolled dysthyroidism, hepatic    failure, unstable ischemic heart disease (unstable angina and/or myocardial    infarction), recent myocardial revascularization procedures (arterial coronary    angioplasty and/ or surgical revascularization in the previous 3 months), severe    arrhythmias, HF secondary to chemotherapy, suspicion of malignancy, or limb    amputations.

The present study was approved by the institutional    ethics committee of biomedical research in humans of the INCMNSZ, and all patients    were informed regarding the purpose of the study and signed informed consent    forms.

Management protocol

Subjects were randomized to intervention group    (IG, n=84), or control group (CG, n=119). Procedure was blinded to the cardiologist    who evaluated the clinical status of patients and to the nutritionist who conducted    the anthropometric and body composition evaluations.

In addition to HF conventional pharmacological    treatment, an isocaloric salt-restricted diet was prescribed to patients in    the intervention group (2000 to 2400 mg/d of sodium) and composed as follow:    of total calories, 50-55% of carbohydrates (with a preference for complex carbohydrates and fiber), 0,8 g of protein    per kg body weight per day, 30-35 % of total lipids (<10% saturated, 10%    polyunsaturated, 15% monounsaturated, and <300 mg/d of cholesterol). Total    fluids were limited to 1,5 L/d, including the water in food. These patients    received written and oral instructions from the dietitian and were advised to    avoid sodium-rich food, limit the intake of food with moderate amounts of sodium,    and eat no more than one-fourth a teaspoon of salt per day. Adherence to diet    was evaluated by a 24-hours food recall collected every 2 months, and suggestions    and corrections were provided, when necessary.

Patients in the control group received conventional    pharmacological treatment for HF as well as common dietary oral advisories by    the cardiologist regarding decreased sodium and fluid intakes, as it is recommended    by the guidelines (5, 6) for the evaluation and management of patients with    HF.

Anthropometric variables, body composition, dietary    intake, metabolic, and clinical evaluations were performed on all patients at    baseline and 12 months.

Measurements

Anthropometry and body composition. Weight    and height were measured according to the reference manual of anthropometric    standardization (11), and all subjects wore little clothing and were barefoot.    Body mass index was calculated by dividing total body weight (kilograms) by    height squared (square meters). Body composition was evaluated with tetrapolar    and multiple-frequencies equipment (BodyStat QuadScan 4000), and extracellular    water (ECW) was obtained.

Dietary intake. Dietary intake data were    obtained by a 3-day food record. Nutrients obtained from a 3-day average of    food records were analyzed with a compu-terized nutrition datábase (SCVAN 1,0,    1993, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición SZ, México City, México),    which contains the nutritional valúes of Mexican food. Missing foods were added    by using the Mexican Food and Nutrient Valúes Tables (12). Sodium intake was    evaluated by twenty-four-hour uriñe samples, assuming that 24-hour urinary sodium    excretion is equi-valent to approximately 86% of the daily sodium intake, as    reported by Korhonen et al. (13).

Biochemical analysis. Fasting blood samples    were analyzed for plasma concentrations of glucose, albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit,    triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and    low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Plasma glucose was enzymatically determined    with the glucose oxidase technique, and plasma concentrations of total cholesterol    and triglycerides were measured with an automated system (Synchron CX5, Beckman    Instruments). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was precipitated with phosphotungstic    acid and Mg2+, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated as follows:    total cholesterol - (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol + triglycerides/5).    We defined dyslipidemia as a total cholesterol level above 200 mg/ dL, a low-density    lipoprotein cholesterol level above 100 mg/dL, and/or a triglycerides level    above 150 mg/dL.

Clinical Data. Symptoms such as fatigue,    dyspnea, edema, and functional class according the New York Heart Association    (NYHA) (14) were evaluated during the medical interview. Functional capacity    was measured in metabolic equivalents (METs, where one MET is 3,5 mL/kg per    min of oxygen consumption) with symptom-limited treadmill exercise testing,    conducted according to modified Bruce protocol (15). Also, all patients underwent    a transthoracic echocardiogram to determine ventricular function.

Endpoints

Primary endpoints (prognosis). Cardiovascular    hospitalizations (HF decompensate, cardiac arrhythmias, acute pulmonary embolism,    acute pulmonary edema, and acute coronary syndromes) and 12 months survival,    were primary endpoints.

Secondary Endpoints. Decrease of symptoms    (edema, dyspnea or fatigue) expressed as percentage of decrease at the end of    the study respect to the baseline, and increase in physical effort achieved,    were considered secondary endpoints.

Statistic analysis

All analyses were performed with commercially    available software (SPSS 15,0 for Windows, SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous    variables are expressed as mean + standard deviation, and categorical variables    are presented as relative frequencies. For the baseline comparison between the    groups on continúes variables independent-sampies t was used and for categorical    variables X2.

Changes observed at 12 months of follow-up on    continuous variables were presented as percentages of change respect to the    baseline. Percentages of change were compared between groups by Mann-Whitney    U test. Changes on categorical variables into each group were evaluated by Mac-Nemar    test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with Log rank significance test was also    performed.

For the analysis of the study variables, excepting    survival, patients that were lost to follow-up, for whom final measurements    were not available, and those who failed in adherence to diet were not included.    For the survival analysis, only non-adherence patients were eliminated.

RESULTS

Of the 203 patients included in the present study    (IG=84 y CG=119), ten were lost to follow-up, four died, and eight were eliminated    from the intervention group due to non-adherence to the diet. In the control    group, thirteen were lost to follow-up and 12 died (figure    1).

   

Baseline

Baseline characteristics by group are listed    in table 1. Fatigue was more frequent in the IG and functional    capacity achieved was worse for this same group. At the beginning of the study    all patients were taking two or more of the following drugs administrated at    high-dose according to patient tolerance: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting    enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, digitalis,    oral nitrates and aldosterone receptor antagonists.

   

For the evaluation of cardiac function patients    were divided into systolic and diastolic heart failure groups. Among systolic    heart failure patients it was observed a lower mean ejection fraction for the    IG. There were not significant differences between groups in diastolic heart    failure subjects (table 2).

   

Mean nutrient intake at baseline was similar    between groups (data not shown).

Follow-up

At the end of the study, there were no significant    differences in the anthropometric variables (weight and BMI) between the two    groups, unlike body composition parameters, where the percentage change of extracellular    water decreased in the intervention group and increased in the controls (-1,4±5,0    vs. 1,2±4,4%; p=0,03). Regar-ding biochemical parameters, hematocrit    showed a significant increase in the IG in comparison with a decrease in the    CG (2,0+7,3 vs. -3,3+8,4%; p=0,04) (table 3).

   

Mean changes in dietary intake between groups    are shown in table 4. Calories consumption increased in both    groups without significant differences between them, and total lipids intake    diminished in the intervention group as much as in the control. However, dietary    cholesterol consumption showed a significant difference between groups, with    an important decrease in the intervention subjects in comparison with an increase    in the controls. In addition, saturated fatty acids and fluids intakes decrease    in the IG more than in the CG. Also, calcium consumption adjusted by caloric    intake significantly decreased among intervention subjects in comparison with    an increase in the controls.

   

Mean sodium intake showed an increase in both    groups at the end of the study, however, these data did not account for the    salt used in cooking, which represents a major component of salt intake in this    population. For that reason, urinary sodium excretion was determined and a significant    difference between groups for the chan-gepercentage was observed (-16,4±13,7    vs. 8,8±46,5%, p<0,05, for IG and CG, respectively). The mean urinary    sodium excretion at the end of the study corresponded to 1360±398 mg/dL    in the IG and 2357±1202 mg/dL in the CG.

At the end of the study, decrease percentage    of fatigue was significant and higher in the intervention (52,9%, p=0,02) that    in the control group (46,4%, p=NS). Presence of edema decreased 68% in the IG    and 40% in the CG; these differences were not statistically significant. Dyspnea    did not show significant differences for any group.

In the IG, decrease in fatigue was concordant    with the observed one in the METs of activity achieved. Mean change percentage    for METs registered showed a trend to increase in the IG vs. CG (39,6+60,0 vs.    -7,9+34,7%; p=0,08). N YH A functional class improved significantly in both    groups at the end of the study.

 The impact of the diet on cardiac function was    evaluated by heart failure group. In this sense, the improvement on dietary    profile (specifically the decrease in sodium and fluids intakes) had an impact    on cardiac function reflected as a statistically significant increase in the    ejection fraction for the IG vs. CG, among systolic HF subjects (percentages    of change, 49,6+53,5 vs. 5,0+19,8%; p=0,001). The other cardiac parameters did    not show significant differences. Among diastolic HF subjects, there were no    significant differences between study groups.

It is important to emphasize that HF medication    was similar between groups during the follow-up (data not shown).

Prognosis results

Proportion of patients with at least one cardiovascular    hospitalization during follow-up was lower in the IG vs. CG (11,1 vs. 15,7%;    p=0,3); however, this difference was not statistically significant. In addition,    survival showed a trend to be better among intervention patients, since one-year    cumulative probability of survival among subjects with intervention was 93,7%    vs. 88,1% in the CG (figure 2). Of the four deaths registered    in the CG and of the 12 in the CG, 2 (50%) and 8 (66.7%) were cardiovascular    deaths, respectively.

   

DISCUSSION

The present study showed the favorable influence    of a nutritional intervention with restriction of sodium (<2400 mg/d) and    liquid (<1500 ml/d) as part of non-pharmacological treatment in stable systolic    and diastolic heart failure patient (NYHA TIII), with improvement in clinical    status (decrease of fatigue and better functional capacity) and cardiac function    (improved ejection fraction). Indeed, prognosis was better for patients receiving    this nutritional intervention, although differences were not statistically significant.    The lack of significance could be explained, in part, because of the few events    (deaths) observed in both groups and its repercussion on statistical power.

At the end of the study, IG had a higher decrease    in liquid intake. Also, urinary sodium excretion, that evaluates indirectly    the dietary sodium consumption, showed a significant decrease in the IG vs.    CG, obtaining a final mean sodium excretion of 13 60 mg/dL for IG and 2357 mg/dL    for CG; this suggest a sodium intake of 1581 mg/d and 2740 mg/d, for each group    respectively, considering that excretion represents approximately 86% of ingestión.

The sodium and fluid intake can greatly assist    in the maintenance of volume balance in HF patients (16). This was confirmed    in the present study through the decrease in urinary sodium and ECW and an increase    in hemat-crit, even without significant decrease in weight. Beich et al. (4)    suggest that to optimize sodium consumption earlier in the course of the HF    syndrome could prevent the cardio-renal syndrome, perhaps by limiting diuretic    use which may avert the occurrence of this syndrome. Also, it is important to    emphasize that findings in this study suggest that a routine body composition    eva-luation by the bioelectrical impedance method could be particularly useful    to detect fluid overload in the early stages of fluid retention, before apparent    edema appears, and to allow the clinician to modify diuretics prescription,    thereby avoiding functional deterioration, progression of structural abnormalities,    and worsening the quality of life.

Likewise, in these study patients that received    nutritional intervention additional to the significant decrease in ECW at the    end of the follow-up, they also had a decrease in fatigue, corroborated by an    increase in functional capacity (METs). These fmdings can be explained by Chomsky    et al. study (17) which suggests that heart failure patients with volume overloud,    even without clinical evidence (edema), frequently have higher intracardiac    diastolic pressures, and that after removal of this subclinical fluid excess,    exercise tolerance improves. Although the positive results of the present study,    other studies suggest that is possible that a strict low-sodium diet is not    warranted in euvolemic compensated HF patients who are on appropriate evidence-based    therapy (4). In one of these studies, Alvelos et al. (7) attempted to determine    whether sodium restriction was therapeutic in patients assessed to have mild-to    moderate compensated systolic HF. For this purpose, 24 patients with mild-to-moderate    chronic HF were studied, 12 consumed 100 mmol (2300 mg) sodium daily and 12    continued their usual-salt diet (controls) where sodium intake was not restricted    or quantified, during a 15-day period. The findings were that the lower-sodium-intake    group had lower blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion, and more weight    loss (fluid loss) than the normal sodium group. They also had lower B-type natriuretic    peptide (BNP), an indirect marker of heart function, which increases with higher    left ventricular volume and pressure. However, volume depletion induced by the    low-sodium diet led to an activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone    systems. Dopamine synthesis was increased probably as a counter-regulatory mechanism.    The activation of these vasoconstrictors, antinatriuretic, and antidiuretic    systems may had induced a reduction in renal blood flow leading to an increase    in renal sodium and water reabsorption and overall worsening of the neurohumoral    steady state. It is important to mention that all of these euvolemic patients    were taking furosemide (mean dose 86,7±11,9 mg/d).

On the other side, Paterna et al. (8) compared    hospital readmission rates for HF patients based on consumption of a normal-sodium    diet (120 mmol or 2760 mg daily) or a "low-sodium" diet (80 mmol or 1840 mg    daily). The study consisted of 232 compensated HF patients divided into 2 groups    based on prescribed diet, all taking high-dose oral furosemide (250-500 mg,    twice a day) and restricting fluid to 1000 mi per day. The normal-sodium group    had a lower incidence of hospital readmissions and mortality compared with the    low-sodium group. Serum aldosterone and renin levéis were significantly higher    in the "low-sodium" group at follow-up, indicating an increase in neurohormonal    activation. However, BNP was significantly lower at 90 and 180 days of follow-up    in the normal-sodium group. The differences between the findings of those studies    and ours, regarding fluid balance perhaps are due to the high doses of loop    diuretics used by them. So that, as Beich and Yancy stated (4), it would be    necessary an individualized sodium prescription calculated based on such factors    as disease risk, activity level, energy needs, renal and cardiac function, volume    status, medication effects, fluid intake and output.

The intervention group had better survival and    less cardiovascular hospitalizations compared with the control group. Although    these differences were not sta-tistically significant, the significant increase    of ejection fraction among patients with systolic heart failure in the IG could    suggests a better prognosis in these patients, because ejection fraction has    been recognized as one of the most important independent prognostic marker inHF(16,    18).

Additional to the decrease in cholesterol and    sa-turated fatty acids intake in the IG, also it was found a reduction in calcium    intake. This could be in accordance with result of the study of Arcand et al.    (19), they found in stable heart failure patients inadequacies of certain vitamins    and minerals like calcium, magnesium, folate, and vitamins D and E, related    to a not excessive sodium intake. These fmdings highlight the importance of    diet beyond that of sodium restnction.

STUDY LIMITATIONS

This study has two important limitations: first,    patients in NYHA functional class IV were not included, in whom the prognosis    is different and the effect of the nutritional intervention could be different;    and second, there were lost of cases during follow-up and the statistical analysis    included only the patients that had adherence to diet. Thus, the applicability    of our fmdings to other patients with heart failure requires further studies.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, a nutritional intervention with    intake restnction of sodium (<2400 mg/day) and fluid less than 1500 ml/day    had positive effects in stable systolic and diastolic heart failure patients    after one year of follow-up, like decrease in extracellular water and fatigue,    as well as an increase in hematocrit. Also, in systolic heart failure patients,    left ventricular function improved even the better prognosis was not statically    significant.
