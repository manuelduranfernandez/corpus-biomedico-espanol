IMPACTO DE UNA INTERVENCIÓN BASADA EN LA COMUNIDAD, EN EL MAYOR CONSUMO DE FRUTAS Y VEGETALES EN FAMILIAS DE BAJOS INGRESOS, SAO PAULO, BRASIL

RESUMEN

El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar          el impacto inmediato de una intervención comunitaria que buscó          aumentar la participación de frutas y verduras en la alimentación          de familias residentes en un barrio extremamente pobre de la ciudad de          São Paulo. Se trata de un estudio de intervención del tipo          ensayo comunitario no controlado, en una muestra de 36 familias. La intervención          comprendió acciones de educación nutricional de los individuos          y acciones sobre el ambiente visando a la mejoría en la accesibilidad          a frutas y verduras. El impacto inmediato de la intervención fue          evaluado por medio de la comparación de la participación          de frutas y verduras en el valor energético total de los alimentos          adquiridos por las familias en los meses anteriores y posteriores a la          intervención. La intervención se demostró efectiva,          aumentando la disponibilidad relativa de frutas y verduras en 2,58 puntos          porcentuales (IC95%: 0,45 - 4,71).

Inadequate fruit and vegetable intake is          one of the most important risk factors for the global burden of disease          and is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular conditions and certain          types of cancer (1). Fruit and vegetables are an important part of a healthy          diet. In addition to being rich in nutrients, fibers, and bioactive compounds          with functional properties, fruit and vegetables have low energetic density.          The adequate consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with the          maintenance and control of a healthy body weight (2, 3). 

If, on one hand, increasing fruit and vegetable          intake is a priority in the Global Strategy on Diet agenda (4), accomplishing          such a task is a great challenge, since, even in developed countries,          current intake among the population falls far below recommended levels          (5). 

The weight of fruit and vegetables the          total cost of food is indicated as a major obstacle to increasing the          participation of fruit and vegetables          in the dietary pattern, especially among lower-income families (6). In          a prior study, in which we evaluated the determinants of fruit and vegetable          consumption patterns among the adult population of Brazil, both sociodemographic          indicators evaluated - schooling and household assets - independently          increased the odds of adequate consumption of these items (7). In addition          to financial restrictions, other factors have been found to be associated          with low intake of fruit and vegetables in low-income communities. These          include difficulty finding these items in local commerce due to inefficient          production, distribution, and commercialization; lack of habit or motivation          for consuming these items; unawareness of their importance to health;          and lack of culinary ability for their preparation (8,9).  

In order to evaluate the effectiveness          of nutritional interventions on the demand for and consumption of fruit          and vegetables among families living in the low-income 

MATERIALS AND METHOD 

We carried out a non-controlled community-based          intervention study including a sample of 40 families living in two different          neighborhoods of the Grajaú district, in the municipality of Sao          Paulo. Grajaú, in the very south of the municipality, is Sao Paulo's          most populous district (c. 330 000 inhabitants), and one of the poorest          in the city, with the ninth lowest Human Development Index - HDI (0,419)          among the 96 districts in Sao Paulo (10). The two neighborhoods in which          the study was conducted - Jardim Noronha and Jardim Moraes Prado - are          located at the very South of the Grajaú district, and were selected          due to their extremely poor urban infrastructure, especially with respect          to the commercialization of fruit and vegetables. 

The families studied were randomly selected          from a registry compiled by a non-governmental organization performing          social work in the area. Sample size was calculated assuming the intention          to identify, with 95% confidence and 90% power, differences of 50% in          the participation of fruit and vegetable in the diet between baseline          and the post-intervention evaluations. Four of the 40 families refused          to participate in the study, leading to a final sample size of 36 families.          

Nutritional intervention in the community          lasted for five months, including an initial one-month diagnosis period.          Intervention was based on two major approaches: an initial educational          approach aimed at preparing and motivating families and a subsequent environmental          modification that sought to improve access to fruit and vegetables in          the community. 

In the educational intervention, one member          of each family - the one responsible for purchasing and preparing food          in the household - was invited to attend three meetings held in the community          during successive weeks, each of which lasted for approximately two hours.          The first meeting employed a focus group technique, was diagnostic in          character, and sought to identify limitations and/or obstacles to the          consumption of fruit and vegetables in the community. The second meeting          was motivational in character and included a culinary workshop designed          to promote the contact of subjects with different types of fruit and vegetables,          and to provide access to the preparation and degustation of fruit and          vegetable-based dishes. The third meeting was essentially informative          in character. This session was intended to increase subjects' awareness          of the «5-a-day» program, offering the necessary elements for          subjects to reconsider their habits with respect to the consumption of          fruit and veg etables within their          community. The aim of the «5-a-day» program is to promote the          daily consumption of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables, in          order to contribute to the prevention of diet-related diseases. The following          messages were addressed in the present study: benefits to health related          to the consumption of these foods; replacement of less healthy foods with          fruit and vegetables; and the relationship between season, price, and          fruit and vegetable quality.  

The strategy for improving accessibility          to fruit and vegetables was based on the allocation of a cargo vehicle          termed the grocery store on wheels which circulated on streets in the          vicinity of selected households. This strategy was adopted one month after          the end of the educational intervention. The grocery store on wheels supplied          quality fruit and vegetables, purchased at the in natura food supply center          of the municipality of Sao Paulo (CEAGESP), and operated three times a          week during the final eight weeks of the study. 

Impact evaluation was based on family indicators          of food purchasing before and after the intervention. The participation          of fruit and vegetables in the family diet was characterized based on          the percentage of calories coming from these foods over the total calories          purchased for family consumption during a one-month period. To this end,          during the months prior to and following the implementation of the environmental          intervention, families were invited to fill a questionnaire containing          questions on food acquisition, both through purchase and donation, similar          to the questionnaires used in Household Budget Surveys (HBSs). In these          questionnaires, which were constructed as expense notebooks, the household          member responsible for food purchasing, after training and orientation,          recorded, on a day-to-day basis, all food purchases (including beverages)          carried out during the one-month reference period. On a weekly schedule,          a member of the fieldwork would visit the household and supervise notebook          completion. After correction using factors that exclude the non-edible          portions of foods, and using the Virtual Nutri software (Department of          Nutrition, University of Sao Paulo School of Public Health), we calculated,          for each family, the total calories purchased in the one-month period          and the fraction of this total corresponding to fruit and vegetables (percentage          of total calories contributed by fruit and vegetables). 

In order to describe the relative participation          on the total calorie content of other groups of foods, all food items          included in the food purchasing questionnaire were classified into 13          groups: fruit; vegetables; cereals and cereal products; roots, tubers,          and derivate products; pulses; meats (beef, pork, poultry, and fish);          eggs; milk and dairy products; sugar; oils and vegetable fats; animal          fats; processed foods of low nutritional value (es sentially caloric foods          and sources of sugar and/or fat, especially saturated and trans fats;          these include soft drinks and other sweetened artificial drinks, sweets,          biscuits and snacks, processed meats, and sauces and dehydrated mixes);          and, finally, other foods (including additional groups of foods with less          expressive participation in the family diet, such as oleaginous vegetables,          condiments, artificial sweeteners, alcoholic beverages, non-sweetened          beverages, and ready-made meals).  

In addition, at the beginning of the study          we administered a socio-economic characterization questionnaire to each          selected family. The person responsible for food purchasing in the household          responded to a structured questionnaire included questions on schooling          and monthly family income, number of household members, and number of          household assets. 

The effect of the intervention was assessed          based on the observed temporal variation (before the intervention and          after the introduction of the grocery store on wheels) in the participation          of fruit and vegetables in the total calorie content of the monthly family          food purchase. As a secondary objective, we evaluated variation in the          relative participation of the remaining food groups, in an attempt to          identify changes in the families' global dietary pattern. For statistical          analysis, we used the paired Student's t-test for differences between          means. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS software (version 11),          considering 95% confidence intervals and a significance level of 5%. The          present study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University          of Sao Paulo School of Public Health. 

Sociodemographic and economic indicators          found among the studied families show evidence of the low purchasing power          of the present sample, as does the relatively low level of schooling of          the family member who participated in the educational intervention. The          food purchasing survey conducted at the baseline showed a relative participation          of fruit and vegetables of 4.57% of the total calorie content purchased.          The availability of fruit was greater than that of vegetables - 3.61%          of total calories versus 0.97%, respectively (Table 1).               

Table 2 shows the immediate          impact of the educational and environmental interventions through a description          of the participation of fruit and vegetables in the total calorie content          of food purchases in the months before and following the interventions.          We found an increase of 56.4% in the participation of fruit and vegetables.          There was a 2.58 percentage-point increase (95%CI: 0.45 - 4.71) in the          percentage of calories contributed by fruit and vegetables, of which 1.76          point was contributed by fruit alone and 0.82, by vegetables alone.      

In the secondary analysis of the general          dietary pattern of families, we evaluated the relative participation of          different foods and food groups in the diet before and after the intervention.          We found a 4.92 percentage point increase in the contribution of cereals          and cereal products in the total calorie content of the monthly food purchase          of studied families. The remaining foods and food groups did not show          statistically significant variation during the five-month period investigated          (Table 3).       DISCUSSION 

The central paradigm adopted in the present          study is that interventions aimed at modifying diet-related behavior and          promoting a healthy diet must necessarily focus on the environmental determinants          of the problems addressed (11, 12). Environmental interventions may be          defined as strategies to reduce barriers against, and increase opportunities          for healthy choices, be it by creating healthier choices or by making          these choices more accessible through increased availability and/or lower          price (13). The concept of accessibility adopted in the present study          may be formulated as the adequate availability of commercial system for          fruit and vegetables, which must be regular, of good quality, close to          subjects' homes, and provide affordable prices. This may lead to a reduction          of barriers and to an increase in opportunities for healthier dietary          choices. Prior studies have demonstrated that nutritional education measures,          especially those that emphasize social interaction, in combination with          environmental interventions, may help low-income consumers to increase          fruit and vegetable intake and to follow the guidelines for a healthy          diet (14, 15).  In the present study, the initial participation          of fruit and vegetables in the total calorie content of the studied families          (4.57%) was below the recommendations of the Guia Alimentar para a População          Brasileira (Food-based Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population),          which is between 9% and 12% of total calorie intake (16). The nutritional          intervention adopted, which included both educational and environmental          components, was effective, leading to an increase in the availability          of fruit and vegetables in the household (a 2.58% percentage point increase,          95%CI 0.45 - 4.71).  The hypothesis of an undesirable change          in the consumption of other foods, such as sugar and industrialized sauces,          brought about by the greater participation of fruit and vegetables in          the diet is gaining in importance in current literature (11). In the secondary          analysis of the general dietary pattern of the studied families, we observed          a 4.92 percentage point increase in the contribution of cereals and cereal          products to the total calorie content, in addition to the increase in          the participation of fruit and vegetables. There was no significant variation          in the remaining food groups studied. Since the intervention's components,          both educational and environmental, were focused exclusively on the fruit          and vegetable groups, it is unlikely that the small variation seen in          the purchase of cereals is a result of the increased participation of          fruit and vegetables in the diet of the studied families.  The food data in this study can present          some limitations since it deals with household availability and not directly          with food consumption. Even though with limitations, food purchase data          can supply useful information to          describe families' food patterns, especially when indicators are focused          on the relative participation of foods and foods groups and not on absolute          amounts purchased, as in the present study. Furthermore, there is evidence          that data from household budget surveys can keep a good relation with          the individual food consumption (17). Two more important limitations of          the present study were the impossibility of evaluating the effect of the          intervention in relation to a control group, and the lack of a medium          and long-term impact evaluation. These two limitations will be addressed          in our next study on the same subject.

Table 2 shows the immediate          impact of the educational and environmental interventions through a description          of the participation of fruit and vegetables in the total calorie content          of food purchases in the months before and following the interventions.          We found an increase of 56.4% in the participation of fruit and vegetables.          There was a 2.58 percentage-point increase (95%CI: 0.45 - 4.71) in the          percentage of calories contributed by fruit and vegetables, of which 1.76          point was contributed by fruit alone and 0.82, by vegetables alone.      

In the secondary analysis of the general          dietary pattern of families, we evaluated the relative participation of          different foods and food groups in the diet before and after the intervention.          We found a 4.92 percentage point increase in the contribution of cereals          and cereal products in the total calorie content of the monthly food purchase          of studied families. The remaining foods and food groups did not show          statistically significant variation during the five-month period investigated          (Table 3).       DISCUSSION 

The central paradigm adopted in the present          study is that interventions aimed at modifying diet-related behavior and          promoting a healthy diet must necessarily focus on the environmental determinants          of the problems addressed (11, 12). Environmental interventions may be          defined as strategies to reduce barriers against, and increase opportunities          for healthy choices, be it by creating healthier choices or by making          these choices more accessible through increased availability and/or lower          price (13). The concept of accessibility adopted in the present study          may be formulated as the adequate availability of commercial system for          fruit and vegetables, which must be regular, of good quality, close to          subjects' homes, and provide affordable prices. This may lead to a reduction          of barriers and to an increase in opportunities for healthier dietary          choices. Prior studies have demonstrated that nutritional education measures,          especially those that emphasize social interaction, in combination with          environmental interventions, may help low-income consumers to increase          fruit and vegetable intake and to follow the guidelines for a healthy          diet (14, 15).  In the present study, the initial participation          of fruit and vegetables in the total calorie content of the studied families          (4.57%) was below the recommendations of the Guia Alimentar para a População          Brasileira (Food-based Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population),          which is between 9% and 12% of total calorie intake (16). The nutritional          intervention adopted, which included both educational and environmental          components, was effective, leading to an increase in the availability          of fruit and vegetables in the household (a 2.58% percentage point increase,          95%CI 0.45 - 4.71).  The hypothesis of an undesirable change          in the consumption of other foods, such as sugar and industrialized sauces,          brought about by the greater participation of fruit and vegetables in          the diet is gaining in importance in current literature (11). In the secondary          analysis of the general dietary pattern of the studied families, we observed          a 4.92 percentage point increase in the contribution of cereals and cereal          products to the total calorie content, in addition to the increase in          the participation of fruit and vegetables. There was no significant variation          in the remaining food groups studied. Since the intervention's components,          both educational and environmental, were focused exclusively on the fruit          and vegetable groups, it is unlikely that the small variation seen in          the purchase of cereals is a result of the increased participation of          fruit and vegetables in the diet of the studied families.  The food data in this study can present          some limitations since it deals with household availability and not directly          with food consumption. Even though with limitations, food purchase data          can supply useful information to          describe families' food patterns, especially when indicators are focused          on the relative participation of foods and foods groups and not on absolute          amounts purchased, as in the present study. Furthermore, there is evidence          that data from household budget surveys can keep a good relation with          the individual food consumption (17). Two more important limitations of          the present study were the impossibility of evaluating the effect of the          intervention in relation to a control group, and the lack of a medium          and long-term impact evaluation. These two limitations will be addressed          in our next study on the same subject.

In the secondary analysis of the general          dietary pattern of families, we evaluated the relative participation of          different foods and food groups in the diet before and after the intervention.          We found a 4.92 percentage point increase in the contribution of cereals          and cereal products in the total calorie content of the monthly food purchase          of studied families. The remaining foods and food groups did not show          statistically significant variation during the five-month period investigated          (Table 3).       DISCUSSION 

The central paradigm adopted in the present          study is that interventions aimed at modifying diet-related behavior and          promoting a healthy diet must necessarily focus on the environmental determinants          of the problems addressed (11, 12). Environmental interventions may be          defined as strategies to reduce barriers against, and increase opportunities          for healthy choices, be it by creating healthier choices or by making          these choices more accessible through increased availability and/or lower          price (13). The concept of accessibility adopted in the present study          may be formulated as the adequate availability of commercial system for          fruit and vegetables, which must be regular, of good quality, close to          subjects' homes, and provide affordable prices. This may lead to a reduction          of barriers and to an increase in opportunities for healthier dietary          choices. Prior studies have demonstrated that nutritional education measures,          especially those that emphasize social interaction, in combination with          environmental interventions, may help low-income consumers to increase          fruit and vegetable intake and to follow the guidelines for a healthy          diet (14, 15).  In the present study, the initial participation          of fruit and vegetables in the total calorie content of the studied families          (4.57%) was below the recommendations of the Guia Alimentar para a População          Brasileira (Food-based Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population),          which is between 9% and 12% of total calorie intake (16). The nutritional          intervention adopted, which included both educational and environmental          components, was effective, leading to an increase in the availability          of fruit and vegetables in the household (a 2.58% percentage point increase,          95%CI 0.45 - 4.71).  The hypothesis of an undesirable change          in the consumption of other foods, such as sugar and industrialized sauces,          brought about by the greater participation of fruit and vegetables in          the diet is gaining in importance in current literature (11). In the secondary          analysis of the general dietary pattern of the studied families, we observed          a 4.92 percentage point increase in the contribution of cereals and cereal          products to the total calorie content, in addition to the increase in          the participation of fruit and vegetables. There was no significant variation          in the remaining food groups studied. Since the intervention's components,          both educational and environmental, were focused exclusively on the fruit          and vegetable groups, it is unlikely that the small variation seen in          the purchase of cereals is a result of the increased participation of          fruit and vegetables in the diet of the studied families.  The food data in this study can present          some limitations since it deals with household availability and not directly          with food consumption. Even though with limitations, food purchase data          can supply useful information to          describe families' food patterns, especially when indicators are focused          on the relative participation of foods and foods groups and not on absolute          amounts purchased, as in the present study. Furthermore, there is evidence          that data from household budget surveys can keep a good relation with          the individual food consumption (17). Two more important limitations of          the present study were the impossibility of evaluating the effect of the          intervention in relation to a control group, and the lack of a medium          and long-term impact evaluation. These two limitations will be addressed          in our next study on the same subject.
