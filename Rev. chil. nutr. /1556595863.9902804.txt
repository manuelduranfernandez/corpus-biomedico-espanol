MEJORANDO LA EVIDENCIA DE INTERVENCIONES Y PROGRAMAS EFECTIVOS DISEÑADOS PARA AUMENTAR EL CONSUMO DE FRUTAS Y VERDURAS A NIVEL MUNDIAL

RESUMEN

Este artículo de revisión          sistemática de literatura, discute las implicancias de políticas          futuras y de investigación científica sobre la efectividad          de las intervenciones y programas promoviendo el consumo de frutas y verduras          en ambos adultos y niños a lo largo del mundo, realizadas en 2004.          Los resultados indican que pequeños aumentos en el consumo de frutas          y verduras son posibles en subgrupos poblacionales y que estos cambios          pueden ser alcanzados desde varios acercamientos (a niveles individual,          poblacional y desarrollo de políticas macro e intervenciones ambientales)          tanto en niños como en adultos. Mientras muchos programas de promoción          de frutas y verduras han sido conducidos o iniciados en todas las regiones          del mundo, nuestro artículo muestra que los diseños de estudio          utilizados han sido frecuentemente sub-óptimos para evaluar efectividad,          particularmente en países menos desarrollados. Aunque es necesario          mayor esfuerzo para mejorar el diseño y la evaluación de          dichas intervenciones a lo largo del mundo, estos resultados son estimulantes          y sugieren que los gobiernos deben seguir desarrollando políticas          para mejorar la nutrición que tengan un énfasis fuerte en          el consumo de frutas y verduras.

INTRODUCCION 

There is now strong evidence that fruit          and vegetable consumption can prevent a number of chronic non-communicable          diseases including cardiovascular disease and some cancers (1-5). Although          most research has examined the association between consumption in adulthood          and a range of non-communicable diseases, some longitudinal studies have          examined the influence of childhood diet on disease in later life. For          example, a recent follow-up to the 1930s Boyd Orr cohort (6, 7) found          that childhood fruit consumption appeared to be protective against development          of cancer in adulthood (8). 

While evidence increases for the population          health benefits of consuming more fruit and vegetables, nutritional surveys          worldwide show that children and adults in most world regions are not          meeting the minimum consumption goals of 400 g per person per day advocated          by the World Health Organisation and many national governments (9, 10).          Consumption of fruit and vegetables isrelatively          lower amongst children and young people, and in lower socio-economic groups.          Families experiencing food insecurity are particularly vulnerable to low          fruit and vegetable consumption (11, 12).  

There is an increasing expectation that          policies will be based on evidence (13, 14). The WHO has developed a global          fruit and vegetable promotion initiative (15) which fits within the framework          of the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health and complies          with the mandate of the WHO Global strategy for the prevention and control          of non-communicable disease. One of the key conclusions of the 2003 Fruit          and Vegetable Promotion Initiative meeting was the need for an up-to-date          review of all types of interventions focused on increasing fruit and vegetable          intake in all settings and world regions to help the development of effective          and appropriate policies in countries worldwide, and to ensure that current          fruit and vegetable programmes (such as those underway in the USA, Europe          and Latin America) have maximized          their potential to improve public health. As a result of this, a systematic          review of the effectiveness of interventions and programs promoting fruit          and vegetable intake in both adults and children which was carried out          in 2004. This paper summarises the results of this review and discusses          the implications of the findings for future policy and research to improve          the evidence-base of effective approaches particularly in less developed          countries. Full methods and results of the systematic review have been          published elsewhere (16,17).  

METHODS 

In April 2004, thirteen publication databases          were searched from the earliest record, including PUBMED, and the Cochrane          Library. The search strategy was designed to be used in PUBMED and adapted          to the other databases. We also searched reference lists of articles found          and contacted 139 experts in the field from all regions of the world.          We considered all publications in eight languages including English and          Spanish that reported on interventions and promotion programs planned          to increase intake of fruit and/or vegetables in free-living adults and          children who were not acutely ill. The studies had follow-up periods greater          or equal to three months and had a control group. The outcome of interest          was a change in fruit and/or vegetable intake, derived from self-reported          measures or observation, or from availability data (if used as a proxy          for intake). 

The effect size was estimated using one          of three methods depending on data available in the publications; (i)          the difference between intervention and control groups in the change in          intake between baseline and follow-up (net effect); (ii) the differences          between the intervention and control groups at follow-up; (iii) change          in intakes within each group. 

RESULTS 

Of the nearly 3500 unduplicated records          identified by the search, 69 articles reporting results of 59 independent          studies met our inclusion criteria and were thus selected for review.          Of these, forty-four studies were of adults (16-69 years) and fifteen          studies focused on children. Because of the heterogeneity in the study          populations, types of interventions and outcome assessment measures, a          meta-analysis was not attempted. The general characteristics of the included          studies are briefly summarised in tables 1 and 2.               

RESULTS FOR CHILDREN  None of the 15 studies of fruit and vegetable          intake promotion among children of primary and secondary school-age showed          a detrimental effect on fruit and vegetable consumption. Eleven studies          had a significant ef fect in increasing          intake.   A closer examination of the studies revealed          that certain intervention components are associated with successful results          (though these interpretations could not be directly and systematically          tested), and that the more students are exposed to fruit and vegetables,          the more consumption patterns improve (17). Intervention components include          giving children ownership of projects to promote fruit and vegetables,          for example encouraging them to be peer leaders and teach a class on the          subject, as described in the TEENS intervention (18). Another sort of          peer educator, that seen in cartoon characters such as the «Food          Dudes» primary school intervention in the UK, has proved to be an          effective motivator for change in children's fruit and vegetable consumption.          Since our original review was published more evidence on the `Food Dudes'          programme further demonstrates the effectiveness of combining video-based          peer modelling with rewards for increasing children's fruit and vegetable          intake (19). Actively involving as many partners as possible in the promotion          of fruit and vegetables was also cited as a key factor for success, such          as teachers, food service staff, parents, local shops. In the Eat Well          and Keep Moving intervention (20), the school provided links with local          low-cost nutrition courses to parents; in one study, verbal encouragement          by the school food service staff was associated with significantly higher          intakes on at least one occasion (21).  RESULTS FOR ADULTS  The review of 44 studies of interventions          intended to promote fruit and vegetable intake in adults found that none          led to a lowering of fruit and vegetable intake in the target populations.          On the contrary, most interventions led to an increase in intake compared          with control groups. Table 2 gives an overview of          the included studies, full details are contained elsewhere (16).     

 

The largest effects were generally observed          among individuals who were already at a higher risk for disease. This          could reflect an elevated motivation among these individuals to improve          their dietary intake, suggesting that they should be considered separately          from the general population. In other study populations the increase in          fruit and vegetable intake ranged from about +0.1 to +1.4 serving/day.          Relatively greater effects were seen in those studies involving face-to-face          counselling interventions, but there was no consistent change in intake          related to the intensity of contact. The observation that interventions          employing a more personal approach appeared slightly more effective seems          intuitive. However, this must be balanced against the higher cost, the          greater time demands and need for trained staff that this approach would          require. This does not seem to be a feasible whole-population          approach.   Printed, individually-tailored information          and computer-based information (particularly if this was individually          tailored) appeared to be a reasonable alternative to face-to-face or telephone          contact. Clearly this is the easiest and cheapest individual-based approach.          Computer-tailored education is an innovative tool to encourage people          to make healthy dietary changes. Because it provides individualized feedback          about one's dietary behaviours, motivation,          attitudes, norms, and/or skills, it mimics the process of «person-to-person»          dietary counselling. Available evidence suggests that computer-tailored          nutrition education is more effective in motivating people to make dietary          changes than general nutrition information. However, no trials of this          were found outside Europe and the United States and potential use of this          technique in rural settings (especially in developing countries) is low.              Worksites          are a potentially valuable setting for delivering interventions promoting          fruit and vegetables in adults. However, they require a comprehensive          approach with many components, which is time and resource intensive, as          well as requiring the collaboration of the company and other stakeholders.          Unfortunately, so far, the effect sizes reported in such programmes have          not been very large. However, this may reflect the diffuse nature of such          multi-component interventions.  Community-wide approaches (including          those  that did not          meet the review inclusion criteria) Although our review identified reports          of various local, regional and national programmes from countries worldwide,          most evaluations did not use a control group and had to be excluded from          the review. For this and other reasons, it was difficult to assess the          effectiveness of national and community-wide approaches. Some examples          of programmes that were not included in this review are provided in tables          3 and 4 to give a clear understanding of the range          of fruit and vegetable promotion initiatives that have been undertaken          worldwide. These include «5 a Day» and equivalent marketing          campaigns, or nutrition education and information programmes. Many of          these have been established for several years but with no formal evaluation          of their effectiveness on fruit and vegetable intake. National fruit and          vegetable programmes have been set up in many countries worldwide and          have used a variety of approaches (Table 3 lists various          national schemes to promoting fruit and vegetable consumption). In developing          countries, a range of intersectorial projects have also been established          to encourage production and consumption of fruit and/or vegetables, often          as local food-based initiatives to reduce micronutrient deficiency or          focused on household income (Table 4 includes examples          from different world regions).      

   

DISCUSSION  This review clearly indicated that the          majority of the fruit and vegetable interventions examined were effective          in increasing intake.  In terms of promoting fruit and vegetables          to children, several lessons were learnt from the systematic review. First,          researchers and public health practitioners have to continue to improve          the ways in which fruit and vegetable promotion interventions are carried          out. Most importantly, the interventions or programmes need to have longer          timeframes and they need to be evaluated from the start so that their          effectiveness can be properly assessed. Second, merely improving knowledge          about fruit and vegetables alone is unlikely to have an impact on eating          behaviours, particularly in children. This is critical as fruit and vegetable          intake in children is significantly          lower than national and international guidelines in most countries, as          reflected in the recent Pro Children Cross sectional Survey of a representative          sample of 11 year olds across 9 European countries (22). Policymakers          need to understand that social, economic and physical environments need          to be conducive to enable increased fruit and vegetable consumption. A          final lesson for increasing intake in children, is that schools need to          focus on finding adequate resources to provide healthy foods and supportive          school based nutrition activities. Clearly this should include provision          of fresh fruit and vegetables (bought locally and presented in attractive          ways) which are affordable and readily available to children at breakfast,          snack breaks and/or lunch..   A few lessons can also be learnt from studies          in adults. A main finding was that positive results were observed in a          variety of settings and using a number of approaches. While consistent          positive effects were found in studies involving a more intense approach          (e.g. face-to-face education or counselling), it was interesting to observe          that reasonable effects were also found when less intensive, and thus          cheaper, interventions were used (e.g. telephone contacts or computer-tailored          information).  Our findings are generally consistent with          those of previous reviews of the literature, but which were generally          more limited in scope focusing for example on community intervention programmes,          nutrition education, counselling in primary care units, or behavioural          interventions), or geographically limited, focused on North America, Europe,          or even on the United States only (23,24 25, 26 27). It is also interesting          to see that several fruit and vegetable intake interventions which were          published after April 2004 (the cut-off date of our review search) also          showed positive findings in line with our results. For example Block et          al (2004) (28) tested the effectiveness of an interactive software on          a low-income ethnically diverse group of women in the United States and          they found that at follow-up, intervention groups reported significantly          higher intakes of fruits and vegetables than the control group .  METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS  The systematic review described here identify          a wide range of interventions and programmes promoting fruit and vegetable          intake that have been undertaken in many parts of the world. There are          some methodological limitations which need to be considered. First, although          several bibliographic databases was searched and numerous experts from          all world regions contacted, some studies might have been missed. These          include for example studies published after April 2004. The possibility          of publication bias was not assessed; if present it could have led to          an overly optimistic impression of the effectiveness of  fruit          and vegetable promotion interventions. Secondly, the inclusion criteria          for the review meant that most studies included in the review were from          industrialized countries. For example, excluding studies that lacked a          control group had the unfortunate effect of excluding the majority of          interventions from developing countries, national or large-scale promotion          interventions (some of which having shown positive effects on increasing          fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-test and post test evaluations).          Searches of the literature and contact with experts indicated that fruit          and vegetable promotional activities (for example, education materials,          leaflets, posters, advertising, radio programmes, special events) are          taking places in many countries. However, their effectiveness is either          not being evaluated at all, or not being reviewed with sufficient rigour.          This is particularly the case in developing countries, with no studies          from Africa meeting the selection criteria. Third, fruit and vegetable          intake was based most cases on self-reported information (e.g. food-frequency          questionnaires, 24-hour recalls, food diaries) and is thus subject to          the limitations of dietary assessment methods, particularly for measuring          small changes in dietary intake. In addition, the inability to blind those          involved means that individuals receiving the interventions might have          been more likely to report positive changes (reporting bias) compared          with individuals in control groups, which could lead to an overestimation          of the effect size. Few studies included a clear definition of the foods          considered as fruit and vegetables or of what constituted a serving. Some          studies even included potatoes in the count of fruit and vegetable servings          consumed, contrary to current international recommendations. Fourth, although          a large proportion of the studies examined had relatively long follow-up          times (at least one year), they could not provide information on the long-term          effectiveness of the interventions in terms of fruit and vegetable intakes,          on the risk factors for relapses to lower intakes, nor could they examine          the long-term effects on the risk of major chronic diseases. Finally,          the cost-effectiveness of the different types of interventions could not          be compared because of the lack of information on the costs of the interventions.            BARRIERS TO CONSUMPTION  There is an extensive research literature          on barriers to increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables which need          to be understood when discussing the results of previous interventions          and when designing new interventions. At an individual level, people often          perceive that they eat enough, or that some foods (particularly fruits)          have a high cost, while family eating habits can be difficult to change          (29). Other environmental barriers include the limited supply of fruit          and vegetables (for example  little variety on offer in work canteens or        local shops), poor quality and high cost in low-income areas, lack of skills        in preparing fruits and vegetables, and misperceptions that they are time-consuming        to cook (30). A major barrier to school-based interventions is competition        against other school priorities, with nutrition generally not seen as a        priority in increasingly crowded curricula.  Fruit and vegetable promotion programmes          directed at the general public (for example, through social marketing)          have been popular. There are perceived barriers involving both the fruit          and vegetable industry (where there is often mixed support for generic          fruit and vegetable promotion) and the health sector, where the small          promotional budgets and lack of sustained funding for social marketing          have limited the ability to produce long-term changes in intake.  Worksite interventions offer the possibility          to influence the fruit and vegetable intake of large numbers of adults,          especially men, who tend to have a lower consumption of these foods. However,          for many interventions there have been low rates of recruitment and retention,          and perhaps a limited understanding and assessment of environmental barriers          in different workplaces. Few food-service interventions have focused solely          on fruit and vegetables. Some studies have showed that price reductions          could lead to short-term increases in fruit and vegetable purchases; however,          purchases generally returned to baseline levels within a few weeks after          the intervention.  Several studies have identified that barriers          to increasing fruit and vegetable intake differ in different population          groups due to different social and environmental conditions that affect          their dietary intake. In a US study of elderly people those who were socially          isolated, with missing pairs of posterior teeth, poor self-reported health          and those who were obese had the lowest fruit and vegetable intakes (31).          Innovative programmes such as home delivery schemes may be the only way          by which housebound elderly can increase consumption (32). In low income          groups in developed countries, cost appears to be important but not the          sole barrier. In a US Study, providing vouchers for fruit and vegetables          in social feeding programmes uptake resulted in high uptake (33). In a          UK study, although eating additional fruits and vegetables was perceived          as being prohibitively expensive, overall access and affordability were          only a small part of the `problem' surrounding low fruit and vegetable          consumption in low income consumers (34).  GENERALIZABILITY OF THE          FINDINGS  While this review of the literature contributed          important information for policy makers, its findings cannot be generalised          to all populations worldwide since the  great          majority of studies were carried out in industrialized countries and in          particular in Europe and the United States. Not only are there differences          in the cultural and socioeconomic contexts but also in nutrition priorities.          In developing countries, priorities are still mainly focused on the control          of micronutrient deficiencies and the alleviation of hunger although the          nutrition transition observed in most regions means that this emphasis          is shifting and adults and children are increasingly suffering the double          burden of overnutrition and undernutrition (35). In developing countries          fruit and vegetable promoting programmes are mainly developed as food-based          strategies to alleviate these shortages (36), compared to the focus of          fruit and vegetable programmes in developed countries, which generally          aim to reduce non-communicable disease risks.   In children, another factor that limits          the generalizability of our findings is the fact that the majority of          the studies reviewed were school-based. In contrast it was estimated that          in 2003 121 million school-age children were not in school, with the majority          of these living in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia (37). This warrants          a continued effort to focus both on promoting school attendance as well          as a special emphasis on non-school-based approaches to food and nutrition,          such as home-based food production programmes (36). Other generalizability          issues include the fact that there is very little information on the effectiveness          of fruit and vegetable interventions among subgroups of the adult population,          for example in different ethnic groups, those at high risk of disease.           IMPROVING THE EVIDENCE-BASE          OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WORLDWIDW  While many fruit and vegetable proportion          interventions and programmes have been conducted or initiated throughout          the world, our review indicated that the study design used was in several          cases suboptimal particularly to assess effectiveness. There is thus currently          a strong need to improve the evidence-base of effective interventions,          particularly in non-industrialised countries.  A first step would be to include in the          design of any planned intervention or initiative some measures of effectiveness.          The development of clear methodological guidelines and standard tools          would also be useful to increase confidence in programme evaluations and          to allow valid comparison of interventions. This would involve for example          developing a series of standard measures of fruit and vegetable intake          (appropriate for various climate, culture and level of urbanization) and          tools to measure predictors of intake (that is, knowledge, attitude, social          support). These measures should ideally be          as simple as possible to encourage their use when the intervention, and          not research, is the primary objective.   Standardising the measurement of fruit          and vegetable intake is a particularly important issue. The studies reviewed          used a wide range of data collection methods, from a single-question food-frequency          estimate, to multiple-item food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour recalls,          or several days' food diary. In the United States, several «5 a day»          studies used the same food-frequency questionnaire. This questionnaire          may not be generalizable to other regions, but simple validated tools          could be adapted to different cultural contexts. Whatever tools are used,          any programme evaluation should aim to be explicit about the definition          of fruit, vegetables and juices that are counted, and of realistic portion          sizes. Estimates should exclude potatoes and limit the amount of fruit          juices counted.  Another important issue to increase confidence          in programme evaluation is to include in all study reports a much better          description of the methods used. This should include information on measurement          tools, response rates, randomization method (if used), precise details          of the intervention, training of individuals involved with intervention          delivery, blinding of outcome assessors, and existence of ongoing reinforcement          or maintenance interventions, and generalizability of the findings.  All evaluations should ideally have a control          or comparison group, although it is accepted that this is unrealistic          for national programmes. Randomized controlled trials are still the «gold-standard»          for assessing the effectiveness of interventions, and are the best method          for reducing bias. However, although such trials can be used in developing          countries, the financial costs involved and lack of expertise in some          cases, that limit their use (38). Yet it is feasible and good practice          to incorporate a control group into the evaluation. This should enable          unequivocal findings about the change an intervention has made in the          target population independent of any other interventions that may contaminate          the results.  As study methods improve, intervention          designs may need to address other important issues, including: the potential          use of validated biochemical markers of fruit and vegetable intake and          novel methods of measuring dietary consumption to address concerns about          measurement bias; in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of specific          components of interventions and how these effects vary in different countries,          particularly in developing countries; the examination of factors that          prevent relapse; the assessment of the long-term effectiveness of the          interventions in terms of health outcomes, although the time required          may not be feasible, and the estimation of what constitutes clinically          meaningful changes in in  take; and          the measurement of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to identify          which interventions would be best suited for a particular country or a          region's needs and how best to allocate scarce resources.   CONCLUSIONS  The results of this review of the literature          indicate that small increases in fruit and vegetable intake are possible          in population subgroups, and that these can be achieved by a variety of          approaches in both children and adults. Clearly, effective interventions          for fruit and vegetable promotion will need to include a range of approaches:          individual-level interventions, population-level prevention strategies          and «upstream» macro-level policy and environmental interventions.          Although more work needs to be done to improve the design and methods          of such interventions, these encouraging results and evidence for the          health benefits of dietary fruit and vegetable intake suggest that national          governments should continue to develop policies to improve nutrition which          have a strong emphasis on fruit and vegetable intake. If they are to be          relevant in all regions of the world such policies should take into account          the range of economic, social and environmental factors that influence          food availability and an individual's ability to make healthy choices          in each country and world region.

RESULTS FOR CHILDREN 

None of the 15 studies of fruit and vegetable          intake promotion among children of primary and secondary school-age showed          a detrimental effect on fruit and vegetable consumption. Eleven studies          had a significant ef fect in increasing          intake.  

A closer examination of the studies revealed          that certain intervention components are associated with successful results          (though these interpretations could not be directly and systematically          tested), and that the more students are exposed to fruit and vegetables,          the more consumption patterns improve (17). Intervention components include          giving children ownership of projects to promote fruit and vegetables,          for example encouraging them to be peer leaders and teach a class on the          subject, as described in the TEENS intervention (18). Another sort of          peer educator, that seen in cartoon characters such as the «Food          Dudes» primary school intervention in the UK, has proved to be an          effective motivator for change in children's fruit and vegetable consumption.          Since our original review was published more evidence on the `Food Dudes'          programme further demonstrates the effectiveness of combining video-based          peer modelling with rewards for increasing children's fruit and vegetable          intake (19). Actively involving as many partners as possible in the promotion          of fruit and vegetables was also cited as a key factor for success, such          as teachers, food service staff, parents, local shops. In the Eat Well          and Keep Moving intervention (20), the school provided links with local          low-cost nutrition courses to parents; in one study, verbal encouragement          by the school food service staff was associated with significantly higher          intakes on at least one occasion (21). 

RESULTS FOR ADULTS 

The review of 44 studies of interventions          intended to promote fruit and vegetable intake in adults found that none          led to a lowering of fruit and vegetable intake in the target populations.          On the contrary, most interventions led to an increase in intake compared          with control groups. Table 2 gives an overview of          the included studies, full details are contained elsewhere (16).     

 

The largest effects were generally observed          among individuals who were already at a higher risk for disease. This          could reflect an elevated motivation among these individuals to improve          their dietary intake, suggesting that they should be considered separately          from the general population. In other study populations the increase in          fruit and vegetable intake ranged from about +0.1 to +1.4 serving/day.          Relatively greater effects were seen in those studies involving face-to-face          counselling interventions, but there was no consistent change in intake          related to the intensity of contact. The observation that interventions          employing a more personal approach appeared slightly more effective seems          intuitive. However, this must be balanced against the higher cost, the          greater time demands and need for trained staff that this approach would          require. This does not seem to be a feasible whole-population          approach.   Printed, individually-tailored information          and computer-based information (particularly if this was individually          tailored) appeared to be a reasonable alternative to face-to-face or telephone          contact. Clearly this is the easiest and cheapest individual-based approach.          Computer-tailored education is an innovative tool to encourage people          to make healthy dietary changes. Because it provides individualized feedback          about one's dietary behaviours, motivation,          attitudes, norms, and/or skills, it mimics the process of «person-to-person»          dietary counselling. Available evidence suggests that computer-tailored          nutrition education is more effective in motivating people to make dietary          changes than general nutrition information. However, no trials of this          were found outside Europe and the United States and potential use of this          technique in rural settings (especially in developing countries) is low.              Worksites          are a potentially valuable setting for delivering interventions promoting          fruit and vegetables in adults. However, they require a comprehensive          approach with many components, which is time and resource intensive, as          well as requiring the collaboration of the company and other stakeholders.          Unfortunately, so far, the effect sizes reported in such programmes have          not been very large. However, this may reflect the diffuse nature of such          multi-component interventions.  Community-wide approaches (including          those  that did not          meet the review inclusion criteria) Although our review identified reports          of various local, regional and national programmes from countries worldwide,          most evaluations did not use a control group and had to be excluded from          the review. For this and other reasons, it was difficult to assess the          effectiveness of national and community-wide approaches. Some examples          of programmes that were not included in this review are provided in tables          3 and 4 to give a clear understanding of the range          of fruit and vegetable promotion initiatives that have been undertaken          worldwide. These include «5 a Day» and equivalent marketing          campaigns, or nutrition education and information programmes. Many of          these have been established for several years but with no formal evaluation          of their effectiveness on fruit and vegetable intake. National fruit and          vegetable programmes have been set up in many countries worldwide and          have used a variety of approaches (Table 3 lists various          national schemes to promoting fruit and vegetable consumption). In developing          countries, a range of intersectorial projects have also been established          to encourage production and consumption of fruit and/or vegetables, often          as local food-based initiatives to reduce micronutrient deficiency or          focused on household income (Table 4 includes examples          from different world regions).      

   

DISCUSSION  This review clearly indicated that the          majority of the fruit and vegetable interventions examined were effective          in increasing intake.  In terms of promoting fruit and vegetables          to children, several lessons were learnt from the systematic review. First,          researchers and public health practitioners have to continue to improve          the ways in which fruit and vegetable promotion interventions are carried          out. Most importantly, the interventions or programmes need to have longer          timeframes and they need to be evaluated from the start so that their          effectiveness can be properly assessed. Second, merely improving knowledge          about fruit and vegetables alone is unlikely to have an impact on eating          behaviours, particularly in children. This is critical as fruit and vegetable          intake in children is significantly          lower than national and international guidelines in most countries, as          reflected in the recent Pro Children Cross sectional Survey of a representative          sample of 11 year olds across 9 European countries (22). Policymakers          need to understand that social, economic and physical environments need          to be conducive to enable increased fruit and vegetable consumption. A          final lesson for increasing intake in children, is that schools need to          focus on finding adequate resources to provide healthy foods and supportive          school based nutrition activities. Clearly this should include provision          of fresh fruit and vegetables (bought locally and presented in attractive          ways) which are affordable and readily available to children at breakfast,          snack breaks and/or lunch..   A few lessons can also be learnt from studies          in adults. A main finding was that positive results were observed in a          variety of settings and using a number of approaches. While consistent          positive effects were found in studies involving a more intense approach          (e.g. face-to-face education or counselling), it was interesting to observe          that reasonable effects were also found when less intensive, and thus          cheaper, interventions were used (e.g. telephone contacts or computer-tailored          information).  Our findings are generally consistent with          those of previous reviews of the literature, but which were generally          more limited in scope focusing for example on community intervention programmes,          nutrition education, counselling in primary care units, or behavioural          interventions), or geographically limited, focused on North America, Europe,          or even on the United States only (23,24 25, 26 27). It is also interesting          to see that several fruit and vegetable intake interventions which were          published after April 2004 (the cut-off date of our review search) also          showed positive findings in line with our results. For example Block et          al (2004) (28) tested the effectiveness of an interactive software on          a low-income ethnically diverse group of women in the United States and          they found that at follow-up, intervention groups reported significantly          higher intakes of fruits and vegetables than the control group .  METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS  The systematic review described here identify          a wide range of interventions and programmes promoting fruit and vegetable          intake that have been undertaken in many parts of the world. There are          some methodological limitations which need to be considered. First, although          several bibliographic databases was searched and numerous experts from          all world regions contacted, some studies might have been missed. These          include for example studies published after April 2004. The possibility          of publication bias was not assessed; if present it could have led to          an overly optimistic impression of the effectiveness of  fruit          and vegetable promotion interventions. Secondly, the inclusion criteria          for the review meant that most studies included in the review were from          industrialized countries. For example, excluding studies that lacked a          control group had the unfortunate effect of excluding the majority of          interventions from developing countries, national or large-scale promotion          interventions (some of which having shown positive effects on increasing          fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-test and post test evaluations).          Searches of the literature and contact with experts indicated that fruit          and vegetable promotional activities (for example, education materials,          leaflets, posters, advertising, radio programmes, special events) are          taking places in many countries. However, their effectiveness is either          not being evaluated at all, or not being reviewed with sufficient rigour.          This is particularly the case in developing countries, with no studies          from Africa meeting the selection criteria. Third, fruit and vegetable          intake was based most cases on self-reported information (e.g. food-frequency          questionnaires, 24-hour recalls, food diaries) and is thus subject to          the limitations of dietary assessment methods, particularly for measuring          small changes in dietary intake. In addition, the inability to blind those          involved means that individuals receiving the interventions might have          been more likely to report positive changes (reporting bias) compared          with individuals in control groups, which could lead to an overestimation          of the effect size. Few studies included a clear definition of the foods          considered as fruit and vegetables or of what constituted a serving. Some          studies even included potatoes in the count of fruit and vegetable servings          consumed, contrary to current international recommendations. Fourth, although          a large proportion of the studies examined had relatively long follow-up          times (at least one year), they could not provide information on the long-term          effectiveness of the interventions in terms of fruit and vegetable intakes,          on the risk factors for relapses to lower intakes, nor could they examine          the long-term effects on the risk of major chronic diseases. Finally,          the cost-effectiveness of the different types of interventions could not          be compared because of the lack of information on the costs of the interventions.            BARRIERS TO CONSUMPTION  There is an extensive research literature          on barriers to increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables which need          to be understood when discussing the results of previous interventions          and when designing new interventions. At an individual level, people often          perceive that they eat enough, or that some foods (particularly fruits)          have a high cost, while family eating habits can be difficult to change          (29). Other environmental barriers include the limited supply of fruit          and vegetables (for example  little variety on offer in work canteens or        local shops), poor quality and high cost in low-income areas, lack of skills        in preparing fruits and vegetables, and misperceptions that they are time-consuming        to cook (30). A major barrier to school-based interventions is competition        against other school priorities, with nutrition generally not seen as a        priority in increasingly crowded curricula.  Fruit and vegetable promotion programmes          directed at the general public (for example, through social marketing)          have been popular. There are perceived barriers involving both the fruit          and vegetable industry (where there is often mixed support for generic          fruit and vegetable promotion) and the health sector, where the small          promotional budgets and lack of sustained funding for social marketing          have limited the ability to produce long-term changes in intake.  Worksite interventions offer the possibility          to influence the fruit and vegetable intake of large numbers of adults,          especially men, who tend to have a lower consumption of these foods. However,          for many interventions there have been low rates of recruitment and retention,          and perhaps a limited understanding and assessment of environmental barriers          in different workplaces. Few food-service interventions have focused solely          on fruit and vegetables. Some studies have showed that price reductions          could lead to short-term increases in fruit and vegetable purchases; however,          purchases generally returned to baseline levels within a few weeks after          the intervention.  Several studies have identified that barriers          to increasing fruit and vegetable intake differ in different population          groups due to different social and environmental conditions that affect          their dietary intake. In a US study of elderly people those who were socially          isolated, with missing pairs of posterior teeth, poor self-reported health          and those who were obese had the lowest fruit and vegetable intakes (31).          Innovative programmes such as home delivery schemes may be the only way          by which housebound elderly can increase consumption (32). In low income          groups in developed countries, cost appears to be important but not the          sole barrier. In a US Study, providing vouchers for fruit and vegetables          in social feeding programmes uptake resulted in high uptake (33). In a          UK study, although eating additional fruits and vegetables was perceived          as being prohibitively expensive, overall access and affordability were          only a small part of the `problem' surrounding low fruit and vegetable          consumption in low income consumers (34).  GENERALIZABILITY OF THE          FINDINGS  While this review of the literature contributed          important information for policy makers, its findings cannot be generalised          to all populations worldwide since the  great          majority of studies were carried out in industrialized countries and in          particular in Europe and the United States. Not only are there differences          in the cultural and socioeconomic contexts but also in nutrition priorities.          In developing countries, priorities are still mainly focused on the control          of micronutrient deficiencies and the alleviation of hunger although the          nutrition transition observed in most regions means that this emphasis          is shifting and adults and children are increasingly suffering the double          burden of overnutrition and undernutrition (35). In developing countries          fruit and vegetable promoting programmes are mainly developed as food-based          strategies to alleviate these shortages (36), compared to the focus of          fruit and vegetable programmes in developed countries, which generally          aim to reduce non-communicable disease risks.   In children, another factor that limits          the generalizability of our findings is the fact that the majority of          the studies reviewed were school-based. In contrast it was estimated that          in 2003 121 million school-age children were not in school, with the majority          of these living in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia (37). This warrants          a continued effort to focus both on promoting school attendance as well          as a special emphasis on non-school-based approaches to food and nutrition,          such as home-based food production programmes (36). Other generalizability          issues include the fact that there is very little information on the effectiveness          of fruit and vegetable interventions among subgroups of the adult population,          for example in different ethnic groups, those at high risk of disease.           IMPROVING THE EVIDENCE-BASE          OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WORLDWIDW  While many fruit and vegetable proportion          interventions and programmes have been conducted or initiated throughout          the world, our review indicated that the study design used was in several          cases suboptimal particularly to assess effectiveness. There is thus currently          a strong need to improve the evidence-base of effective interventions,          particularly in non-industrialised countries.  A first step would be to include in the          design of any planned intervention or initiative some measures of effectiveness.          The development of clear methodological guidelines and standard tools          would also be useful to increase confidence in programme evaluations and          to allow valid comparison of interventions. This would involve for example          developing a series of standard measures of fruit and vegetable intake          (appropriate for various climate, culture and level of urbanization) and          tools to measure predictors of intake (that is, knowledge, attitude, social          support). These measures should ideally be          as simple as possible to encourage their use when the intervention, and          not research, is the primary objective.   Standardising the measurement of fruit          and vegetable intake is a particularly important issue. The studies reviewed          used a wide range of data collection methods, from a single-question food-frequency          estimate, to multiple-item food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour recalls,          or several days' food diary. In the United States, several «5 a day»          studies used the same food-frequency questionnaire. This questionnaire          may not be generalizable to other regions, but simple validated tools          could be adapted to different cultural contexts. Whatever tools are used,          any programme evaluation should aim to be explicit about the definition          of fruit, vegetables and juices that are counted, and of realistic portion          sizes. Estimates should exclude potatoes and limit the amount of fruit          juices counted.  Another important issue to increase confidence          in programme evaluation is to include in all study reports a much better          description of the methods used. This should include information on measurement          tools, response rates, randomization method (if used), precise details          of the intervention, training of individuals involved with intervention          delivery, blinding of outcome assessors, and existence of ongoing reinforcement          or maintenance interventions, and generalizability of the findings.  All evaluations should ideally have a control          or comparison group, although it is accepted that this is unrealistic          for national programmes. Randomized controlled trials are still the «gold-standard»          for assessing the effectiveness of interventions, and are the best method          for reducing bias. However, although such trials can be used in developing          countries, the financial costs involved and lack of expertise in some          cases, that limit their use (38). Yet it is feasible and good practice          to incorporate a control group into the evaluation. This should enable          unequivocal findings about the change an intervention has made in the          target population independent of any other interventions that may contaminate          the results.  As study methods improve, intervention          designs may need to address other important issues, including: the potential          use of validated biochemical markers of fruit and vegetable intake and          novel methods of measuring dietary consumption to address concerns about          measurement bias; in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of specific          components of interventions and how these effects vary in different countries,          particularly in developing countries; the examination of factors that          prevent relapse; the assessment of the long-term effectiveness of the          interventions in terms of health outcomes, although the time required          may not be feasible, and the estimation of what constitutes clinically          meaningful changes in in  take; and          the measurement of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to identify          which interventions would be best suited for a particular country or a          region's needs and how best to allocate scarce resources.   CONCLUSIONS  The results of this review of the literature          indicate that small increases in fruit and vegetable intake are possible          in population subgroups, and that these can be achieved by a variety of          approaches in both children and adults. Clearly, effective interventions          for fruit and vegetable promotion will need to include a range of approaches:          individual-level interventions, population-level prevention strategies          and «upstream» macro-level policy and environmental interventions.          Although more work needs to be done to improve the design and methods          of such interventions, these encouraging results and evidence for the          health benefits of dietary fruit and vegetable intake suggest that national          governments should continue to develop policies to improve nutrition which          have a strong emphasis on fruit and vegetable intake. If they are to be          relevant in all regions of the world such policies should take into account          the range of economic, social and environmental factors that influence          food availability and an individual's ability to make healthy choices          in each country and world region.

The largest effects were generally observed          among individuals who were already at a higher risk for disease. This          could reflect an elevated motivation among these individuals to improve          their dietary intake, suggesting that they should be considered separately          from the general population. In other study populations the increase in          fruit and vegetable intake ranged from about +0.1 to +1.4 serving/day.          Relatively greater effects were seen in those studies involving face-to-face          counselling interventions, but there was no consistent change in intake          related to the intensity of contact. The observation that interventions          employing a more personal approach appeared slightly more effective seems          intuitive. However, this must be balanced against the higher cost, the          greater time demands and need for trained staff that this approach would          require. This does not seem to be a feasible whole-population          approach.  

Printed, individually-tailored information          and computer-based information (particularly if this was individually          tailored) appeared to be a reasonable alternative to face-to-face or telephone          contact. Clearly this is the easiest and cheapest individual-based approach.          Computer-tailored education is an innovative tool to encourage people          to make healthy dietary changes. Because it provides individualized feedback          about one's dietary behaviours, motivation,          attitudes, norms, and/or skills, it mimics the process of «person-to-person»          dietary counselling. Available evidence suggests that computer-tailored          nutrition education is more effective in motivating people to make dietary          changes than general nutrition information. However, no trials of this          were found outside Europe and the United States and potential use of this          technique in rural settings (especially in developing countries) is low.           

  Worksites          are a potentially valuable setting for delivering interventions promoting          fruit and vegetables in adults. However, they require a comprehensive          approach with many components, which is time and resource intensive, as          well as requiring the collaboration of the company and other stakeholders.          Unfortunately, so far, the effect sizes reported in such programmes have          not been very large. However, this may reflect the diffuse nature of such          multi-component interventions.

 Community-wide approaches (including          those  that did not          meet the review inclusion criteria)

Although our review identified reports          of various local, regional and national programmes from countries worldwide,          most evaluations did not use a control group and had to be excluded from          the review. For this and other reasons, it was difficult to assess the          effectiveness of national and community-wide approaches. Some examples          of programmes that were not included in this review are provided in tables          3 and 4 to give a clear understanding of the range          of fruit and vegetable promotion initiatives that have been undertaken          worldwide. These include «5 a Day» and equivalent marketing          campaigns, or nutrition education and information programmes. Many of          these have been established for several years but with no formal evaluation          of their effectiveness on fruit and vegetable intake. National fruit and          vegetable programmes have been set up in many countries worldwide and          have used a variety of approaches (Table 3 lists various          national schemes to promoting fruit and vegetable consumption). In developing          countries, a range of intersectorial projects have also been established          to encourage production and consumption of fruit and/or vegetables, often          as local food-based initiatives to reduce micronutrient deficiency or          focused on household income (Table 4 includes examples          from different world regions).      

   

DISCUSSION  This review clearly indicated that the          majority of the fruit and vegetable interventions examined were effective          in increasing intake.  In terms of promoting fruit and vegetables          to children, several lessons were learnt from the systematic review. First,          researchers and public health practitioners have to continue to improve          the ways in which fruit and vegetable promotion interventions are carried          out. Most importantly, the interventions or programmes need to have longer          timeframes and they need to be evaluated from the start so that their          effectiveness can be properly assessed. Second, merely improving knowledge          about fruit and vegetables alone is unlikely to have an impact on eating          behaviours, particularly in children. This is critical as fruit and vegetable          intake in children is significantly          lower than national and international guidelines in most countries, as          reflected in the recent Pro Children Cross sectional Survey of a representative          sample of 11 year olds across 9 European countries (22). Policymakers          need to understand that social, economic and physical environments need          to be conducive to enable increased fruit and vegetable consumption. A          final lesson for increasing intake in children, is that schools need to          focus on finding adequate resources to provide healthy foods and supportive          school based nutrition activities. Clearly this should include provision          of fresh fruit and vegetables (bought locally and presented in attractive          ways) which are affordable and readily available to children at breakfast,          snack breaks and/or lunch..   A few lessons can also be learnt from studies          in adults. A main finding was that positive results were observed in a          variety of settings and using a number of approaches. While consistent          positive effects were found in studies involving a more intense approach          (e.g. face-to-face education or counselling), it was interesting to observe          that reasonable effects were also found when less intensive, and thus          cheaper, interventions were used (e.g. telephone contacts or computer-tailored          information).  Our findings are generally consistent with          those of previous reviews of the literature, but which were generally          more limited in scope focusing for example on community intervention programmes,          nutrition education, counselling in primary care units, or behavioural          interventions), or geographically limited, focused on North America, Europe,          or even on the United States only (23,24 25, 26 27). It is also interesting          to see that several fruit and vegetable intake interventions which were          published after April 2004 (the cut-off date of our review search) also          showed positive findings in line with our results. For example Block et          al (2004) (28) tested the effectiveness of an interactive software on          a low-income ethnically diverse group of women in the United States and          they found that at follow-up, intervention groups reported significantly          higher intakes of fruits and vegetables than the control group .  METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS  The systematic review described here identify          a wide range of interventions and programmes promoting fruit and vegetable          intake that have been undertaken in many parts of the world. There are          some methodological limitations which need to be considered. First, although          several bibliographic databases was searched and numerous experts from          all world regions contacted, some studies might have been missed. These          include for example studies published after April 2004. The possibility          of publication bias was not assessed; if present it could have led to          an overly optimistic impression of the effectiveness of  fruit          and vegetable promotion interventions. Secondly, the inclusion criteria          for the review meant that most studies included in the review were from          industrialized countries. For example, excluding studies that lacked a          control group had the unfortunate effect of excluding the majority of          interventions from developing countries, national or large-scale promotion          interventions (some of which having shown positive effects on increasing          fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-test and post test evaluations).          Searches of the literature and contact with experts indicated that fruit          and vegetable promotional activities (for example, education materials,          leaflets, posters, advertising, radio programmes, special events) are          taking places in many countries. However, their effectiveness is either          not being evaluated at all, or not being reviewed with sufficient rigour.          This is particularly the case in developing countries, with no studies          from Africa meeting the selection criteria. Third, fruit and vegetable          intake was based most cases on self-reported information (e.g. food-frequency          questionnaires, 24-hour recalls, food diaries) and is thus subject to          the limitations of dietary assessment methods, particularly for measuring          small changes in dietary intake. In addition, the inability to blind those          involved means that individuals receiving the interventions might have          been more likely to report positive changes (reporting bias) compared          with individuals in control groups, which could lead to an overestimation          of the effect size. Few studies included a clear definition of the foods          considered as fruit and vegetables or of what constituted a serving. Some          studies even included potatoes in the count of fruit and vegetable servings          consumed, contrary to current international recommendations. Fourth, although          a large proportion of the studies examined had relatively long follow-up          times (at least one year), they could not provide information on the long-term          effectiveness of the interventions in terms of fruit and vegetable intakes,          on the risk factors for relapses to lower intakes, nor could they examine          the long-term effects on the risk of major chronic diseases. Finally,          the cost-effectiveness of the different types of interventions could not          be compared because of the lack of information on the costs of the interventions.            BARRIERS TO CONSUMPTION  There is an extensive research literature          on barriers to increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables which need          to be understood when discussing the results of previous interventions          and when designing new interventions. At an individual level, people often          perceive that they eat enough, or that some foods (particularly fruits)          have a high cost, while family eating habits can be difficult to change          (29). Other environmental barriers include the limited supply of fruit          and vegetables (for example  little variety on offer in work canteens or        local shops), poor quality and high cost in low-income areas, lack of skills        in preparing fruits and vegetables, and misperceptions that they are time-consuming        to cook (30). A major barrier to school-based interventions is competition        against other school priorities, with nutrition generally not seen as a        priority in increasingly crowded curricula.  Fruit and vegetable promotion programmes          directed at the general public (for example, through social marketing)          have been popular. There are perceived barriers involving both the fruit          and vegetable industry (where there is often mixed support for generic          fruit and vegetable promotion) and the health sector, where the small          promotional budgets and lack of sustained funding for social marketing          have limited the ability to produce long-term changes in intake.  Worksite interventions offer the possibility          to influence the fruit and vegetable intake of large numbers of adults,          especially men, who tend to have a lower consumption of these foods. However,          for many interventions there have been low rates of recruitment and retention,          and perhaps a limited understanding and assessment of environmental barriers          in different workplaces. Few food-service interventions have focused solely          on fruit and vegetables. Some studies have showed that price reductions          could lead to short-term increases in fruit and vegetable purchases; however,          purchases generally returned to baseline levels within a few weeks after          the intervention.  Several studies have identified that barriers          to increasing fruit and vegetable intake differ in different population          groups due to different social and environmental conditions that affect          their dietary intake. In a US study of elderly people those who were socially          isolated, with missing pairs of posterior teeth, poor self-reported health          and those who were obese had the lowest fruit and vegetable intakes (31).          Innovative programmes such as home delivery schemes may be the only way          by which housebound elderly can increase consumption (32). In low income          groups in developed countries, cost appears to be important but not the          sole barrier. In a US Study, providing vouchers for fruit and vegetables          in social feeding programmes uptake resulted in high uptake (33). In a          UK study, although eating additional fruits and vegetables was perceived          as being prohibitively expensive, overall access and affordability were          only a small part of the `problem' surrounding low fruit and vegetable          consumption in low income consumers (34).  GENERALIZABILITY OF THE          FINDINGS  While this review of the literature contributed          important information for policy makers, its findings cannot be generalised          to all populations worldwide since the  great          majority of studies were carried out in industrialized countries and in          particular in Europe and the United States. Not only are there differences          in the cultural and socioeconomic contexts but also in nutrition priorities.          In developing countries, priorities are still mainly focused on the control          of micronutrient deficiencies and the alleviation of hunger although the          nutrition transition observed in most regions means that this emphasis          is shifting and adults and children are increasingly suffering the double          burden of overnutrition and undernutrition (35). In developing countries          fruit and vegetable promoting programmes are mainly developed as food-based          strategies to alleviate these shortages (36), compared to the focus of          fruit and vegetable programmes in developed countries, which generally          aim to reduce non-communicable disease risks.   In children, another factor that limits          the generalizability of our findings is the fact that the majority of          the studies reviewed were school-based. In contrast it was estimated that          in 2003 121 million school-age children were not in school, with the majority          of these living in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia (37). This warrants          a continued effort to focus both on promoting school attendance as well          as a special emphasis on non-school-based approaches to food and nutrition,          such as home-based food production programmes (36). Other generalizability          issues include the fact that there is very little information on the effectiveness          of fruit and vegetable interventions among subgroups of the adult population,          for example in different ethnic groups, those at high risk of disease.           IMPROVING THE EVIDENCE-BASE          OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WORLDWIDW  While many fruit and vegetable proportion          interventions and programmes have been conducted or initiated throughout          the world, our review indicated that the study design used was in several          cases suboptimal particularly to assess effectiveness. There is thus currently          a strong need to improve the evidence-base of effective interventions,          particularly in non-industrialised countries.  A first step would be to include in the          design of any planned intervention or initiative some measures of effectiveness.          The development of clear methodological guidelines and standard tools          would also be useful to increase confidence in programme evaluations and          to allow valid comparison of interventions. This would involve for example          developing a series of standard measures of fruit and vegetable intake          (appropriate for various climate, culture and level of urbanization) and          tools to measure predictors of intake (that is, knowledge, attitude, social          support). These measures should ideally be          as simple as possible to encourage their use when the intervention, and          not research, is the primary objective.   Standardising the measurement of fruit          and vegetable intake is a particularly important issue. The studies reviewed          used a wide range of data collection methods, from a single-question food-frequency          estimate, to multiple-item food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour recalls,          or several days' food diary. In the United States, several «5 a day»          studies used the same food-frequency questionnaire. This questionnaire          may not be generalizable to other regions, but simple validated tools          could be adapted to different cultural contexts. Whatever tools are used,          any programme evaluation should aim to be explicit about the definition          of fruit, vegetables and juices that are counted, and of realistic portion          sizes. Estimates should exclude potatoes and limit the amount of fruit          juices counted.  Another important issue to increase confidence          in programme evaluation is to include in all study reports a much better          description of the methods used. This should include information on measurement          tools, response rates, randomization method (if used), precise details          of the intervention, training of individuals involved with intervention          delivery, blinding of outcome assessors, and existence of ongoing reinforcement          or maintenance interventions, and generalizability of the findings.  All evaluations should ideally have a control          or comparison group, although it is accepted that this is unrealistic          for national programmes. Randomized controlled trials are still the «gold-standard»          for assessing the effectiveness of interventions, and are the best method          for reducing bias. However, although such trials can be used in developing          countries, the financial costs involved and lack of expertise in some          cases, that limit their use (38). Yet it is feasible and good practice          to incorporate a control group into the evaluation. This should enable          unequivocal findings about the change an intervention has made in the          target population independent of any other interventions that may contaminate          the results.  As study methods improve, intervention          designs may need to address other important issues, including: the potential          use of validated biochemical markers of fruit and vegetable intake and          novel methods of measuring dietary consumption to address concerns about          measurement bias; in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of specific          components of interventions and how these effects vary in different countries,          particularly in developing countries; the examination of factors that          prevent relapse; the assessment of the long-term effectiveness of the          interventions in terms of health outcomes, although the time required          may not be feasible, and the estimation of what constitutes clinically          meaningful changes in in  take; and          the measurement of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to identify          which interventions would be best suited for a particular country or a          region's needs and how best to allocate scarce resources.   CONCLUSIONS  The results of this review of the literature          indicate that small increases in fruit and vegetable intake are possible          in population subgroups, and that these can be achieved by a variety of          approaches in both children and adults. Clearly, effective interventions          for fruit and vegetable promotion will need to include a range of approaches:          individual-level interventions, population-level prevention strategies          and «upstream» macro-level policy and environmental interventions.          Although more work needs to be done to improve the design and methods          of such interventions, these encouraging results and evidence for the          health benefits of dietary fruit and vegetable intake suggest that national          governments should continue to develop policies to improve nutrition which          have a strong emphasis on fruit and vegetable intake. If they are to be          relevant in all regions of the world such policies should take into account          the range of economic, social and environmental factors that influence          food availability and an individual's ability to make healthy choices          in each country and world region.

DISCUSSION 

This review clearly indicated that the          majority of the fruit and vegetable interventions examined were effective          in increasing intake. 

In terms of promoting fruit and vegetables          to children, several lessons were learnt from the systematic review. First,          researchers and public health practitioners have to continue to improve          the ways in which fruit and vegetable promotion interventions are carried          out. Most importantly, the interventions or programmes need to have longer          timeframes and they need to be evaluated from the start so that their          effectiveness can be properly assessed. Second, merely improving knowledge          about fruit and vegetables alone is unlikely to have an impact on eating          behaviours, particularly in children. This is critical as fruit and vegetable          intake in children is significantly          lower than national and international guidelines in most countries, as          reflected in the recent Pro Children Cross sectional Survey of a representative          sample of 11 year olds across 9 European countries (22). Policymakers          need to understand that social, economic and physical environments need          to be conducive to enable increased fruit and vegetable consumption. A          final lesson for increasing intake in children, is that schools need to          focus on finding adequate resources to provide healthy foods and supportive          school based nutrition activities. Clearly this should include provision          of fresh fruit and vegetables (bought locally and presented in attractive          ways) which are affordable and readily available to children at breakfast,          snack breaks and/or lunch..  

A few lessons can also be learnt from studies          in adults. A main finding was that positive results were observed in a          variety of settings and using a number of approaches. While consistent          positive effects were found in studies involving a more intense approach          (e.g. face-to-face education or counselling), it was interesting to observe          that reasonable effects were also found when less intensive, and thus          cheaper, interventions were used (e.g. telephone contacts or computer-tailored          information). 

Our findings are generally consistent with          those of previous reviews of the literature, but which were generally          more limited in scope focusing for example on community intervention programmes,          nutrition education, counselling in primary care units, or behavioural          interventions), or geographically limited, focused on North America, Europe,          or even on the United States only (23,24 25, 26 27). It is also interesting          to see that several fruit and vegetable intake interventions which were          published after April 2004 (the cut-off date of our review search) also          showed positive findings in line with our results. For example Block et          al (2004) (28) tested the effectiveness of an interactive software on          a low-income ethnically diverse group of women in the United States and          they found that at follow-up, intervention groups reported significantly          higher intakes of fruits and vegetables than the control group . 

METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS 

The systematic review described here identify          a wide range of interventions and programmes promoting fruit and vegetable          intake that have been undertaken in many parts of the world. There are          some methodological limitations which need to be considered. First, although          several bibliographic databases was searched and numerous experts from          all world regions contacted, some studies might have been missed. These          include for example studies published after April 2004. The possibility          of publication bias was not assessed; if present it could have led to          an overly optimistic impression of the effectiveness of  fruit          and vegetable promotion interventions. Secondly, the inclusion criteria          for the review meant that most studies included in the review were from          industrialized countries. For example, excluding studies that lacked a          control group had the unfortunate effect of excluding the majority of          interventions from developing countries, national or large-scale promotion          interventions (some of which having shown positive effects on increasing          fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-test and post test evaluations).          Searches of the literature and contact with experts indicated that fruit          and vegetable promotional activities (for example, education materials,          leaflets, posters, advertising, radio programmes, special events) are          taking places in many countries. However, their effectiveness is either          not being evaluated at all, or not being reviewed with sufficient rigour.          This is particularly the case in developing countries, with no studies          from Africa meeting the selection criteria. Third, fruit and vegetable          intake was based most cases on self-reported information (e.g. food-frequency          questionnaires, 24-hour recalls, food diaries) and is thus subject to          the limitations of dietary assessment methods, particularly for measuring          small changes in dietary intake. In addition, the inability to blind those          involved means that individuals receiving the interventions might have          been more likely to report positive changes (reporting bias) compared          with individuals in control groups, which could lead to an overestimation          of the effect size. Few studies included a clear definition of the foods          considered as fruit and vegetables or of what constituted a serving. Some          studies even included potatoes in the count of fruit and vegetable servings          consumed, contrary to current international recommendations. Fourth, although          a large proportion of the studies examined had relatively long follow-up          times (at least one year), they could not provide information on the long-term          effectiveness of the interventions in terms of fruit and vegetable intakes,          on the risk factors for relapses to lower intakes, nor could they examine          the long-term effects on the risk of major chronic diseases. Finally,          the cost-effectiveness of the different types of interventions could not          be compared because of the lack of information on the costs of the interventions.           

BARRIERS TO CONSUMPTION 

There is an extensive research literature          on barriers to increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables which need          to be understood when discussing the results of previous interventions          and when designing new interventions. At an individual level, people often          perceive that they eat enough, or that some foods (particularly fruits)          have a high cost, while family eating habits can be difficult to change          (29). Other environmental barriers include the limited supply of fruit          and vegetables (for example 

Fruit and vegetable promotion programmes          directed at the general public (for example, through social marketing)          have been popular. There are perceived barriers involving both the fruit          and vegetable industry (where there is often mixed support for generic          fruit and vegetable promotion) and the health sector, where the small          promotional budgets and lack of sustained funding for social marketing          have limited the ability to produce long-term changes in intake. 

Worksite interventions offer the possibility          to influence the fruit and vegetable intake of large numbers of adults,          especially men, who tend to have a lower consumption of these foods. However,          for many interventions there have been low rates of recruitment and retention,          and perhaps a limited understanding and assessment of environmental barriers          in different workplaces. Few food-service interventions have focused solely          on fruit and vegetables. Some studies have showed that price reductions          could lead to short-term increases in fruit and vegetable purchases; however,          purchases generally returned to baseline levels within a few weeks after          the intervention. 

Several studies have identified that barriers          to increasing fruit and vegetable intake differ in different population          groups due to different social and environmental conditions that affect          their dietary intake. In a US study of elderly people those who were socially          isolated, with missing pairs of posterior teeth, poor self-reported health          and those who were obese had the lowest fruit and vegetable intakes (31).          Innovative programmes such as home delivery schemes may be the only way          by which housebound elderly can increase consumption (32). In low income          groups in developed countries, cost appears to be important but not the          sole barrier. In a US Study, providing vouchers for fruit and vegetables          in social feeding programmes uptake resulted in high uptake (33). In a          UK study, although eating additional fruits and vegetables was perceived          as being prohibitively expensive, overall access and affordability were          only a small part of the `problem' surrounding low fruit and vegetable          consumption in low income consumers (34). 

GENERALIZABILITY OF THE          FINDINGS 

While this review of the literature contributed          important information for policy makers, its findings cannot be generalised          to all populations worldwide since the  great          majority of studies were carried out in industrialized countries and in          particular in Europe and the United States. Not only are there differences          in the cultural and socioeconomic contexts but also in nutrition priorities.          In developing countries, priorities are still mainly focused on the control          of micronutrient deficiencies and the alleviation of hunger although the          nutrition transition observed in most regions means that this emphasis          is shifting and adults and children are increasingly suffering the double          burden of overnutrition and undernutrition (35). In developing countries          fruit and vegetable promoting programmes are mainly developed as food-based          strategies to alleviate these shortages (36), compared to the focus of          fruit and vegetable programmes in developed countries, which generally          aim to reduce non-communicable disease risks.  

In children, another factor that limits          the generalizability of our findings is the fact that the majority of          the studies reviewed were school-based. In contrast it was estimated that          in 2003 121 million school-age children were not in school, with the majority          of these living in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia (37). This warrants          a continued effort to focus both on promoting school attendance as well          as a special emphasis on non-school-based approaches to food and nutrition,          such as home-based food production programmes (36). Other generalizability          issues include the fact that there is very little information on the effectiveness          of fruit and vegetable interventions among subgroups of the adult population,          for example in different ethnic groups, those at high risk of disease.          

IMPROVING THE EVIDENCE-BASE          OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WORLDWIDW 

While many fruit and vegetable proportion          interventions and programmes have been conducted or initiated throughout          the world, our review indicated that the study design used was in several          cases suboptimal particularly to assess effectiveness. There is thus currently          a strong need to improve the evidence-base of effective interventions,          particularly in non-industrialised countries. 

A first step would be to include in the          design of any planned intervention or initiative some measures of effectiveness.          The development of clear methodological guidelines and standard tools          would also be useful to increase confidence in programme evaluations and          to allow valid comparison of interventions. This would involve for example          developing a series of standard measures of fruit and vegetable intake          (appropriate for various climate, culture and level of urbanization) and          tools to measure predictors of intake (that is, knowledge, attitude, social          support). These measures should ideally be          as simple as possible to encourage their use when the intervention, and          not research, is the primary objective.  

Standardising the measurement of fruit          and vegetable intake is a particularly important issue. The studies reviewed          used a wide range of data collection methods, from a single-question food-frequency          estimate, to multiple-item food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour recalls,          or several days' food diary. In the United States, several «5 a day»          studies used the same food-frequency questionnaire. This questionnaire          may not be generalizable to other regions, but simple validated tools          could be adapted to different cultural contexts. Whatever tools are used,          any programme evaluation should aim to be explicit about the definition          of fruit, vegetables and juices that are counted, and of realistic portion          sizes. Estimates should exclude potatoes and limit the amount of fruit          juices counted. 

Another important issue to increase confidence          in programme evaluation is to include in all study reports a much better          description of the methods used. This should include information on measurement          tools, response rates, randomization method (if used), precise details          of the intervention, training of individuals involved with intervention          delivery, blinding of outcome assessors, and existence of ongoing reinforcement          or maintenance interventions, and generalizability of the findings. 

All evaluations should ideally have a control          or comparison group, although it is accepted that this is unrealistic          for national programmes. Randomized controlled trials are still the «gold-standard»          for assessing the effectiveness of interventions, and are the best method          for reducing bias. However, although such trials can be used in developing          countries, the financial costs involved and lack of expertise in some          cases, that limit their use (38). Yet it is feasible and good practice          to incorporate a control group into the evaluation. This should enable          unequivocal findings about the change an intervention has made in the          target population independent of any other interventions that may contaminate          the results. 

As study methods improve, intervention          designs may need to address other important issues, including: the potential          use of validated biochemical markers of fruit and vegetable intake and          novel methods of measuring dietary consumption to address concerns about          measurement bias; in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of specific          components of interventions and how these effects vary in different countries,          particularly in developing countries; the examination of factors that          prevent relapse; the assessment of the long-term effectiveness of the          interventions in terms of health outcomes, although the time required          may not be feasible, and the estimation of what constitutes clinically          meaningful changes in in  take; and          the measurement of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to identify          which interventions would be best suited for a particular country or a          region's needs and how best to allocate scarce resources.  

CONCLUSIONS 

The results of this review of the literature          indicate that small increases in fruit and vegetable intake are possible          in population subgroups, and that these can be achieved by a variety of          approaches in both children and adults. Clearly, effective interventions          for fruit and vegetable promotion will need to include a range of approaches:          individual-level interventions, population-level prevention strategies          and «upstream» macro-level policy and environmental interventions.          Although more work needs to be done to improve the design and methods          of such interventions, these encouraging results and evidence for the          health benefits of dietary fruit and vegetable intake suggest that national          governments should continue to develop policies to improve nutrition which          have a strong emphasis on fruit and vegetable intake. If they are to be          relevant in all regions of the world such policies should take into account          the range of economic, social and environmental factors that influence          food availability and an individual's ability to make healthy choices          in each country and world region.
